      content: `# Letter from Sam's Parents to Kailu's Parents

**Purpose:** Sam's parents write to Kailu's parents in advance of Sam's China visit (Feb 11+, Chongqing Feb 18-25), expressing warmth toward the relationship and interest in meeting the family. This lays the groundwork for Sam to ask for their blessing to propose.

**Note to Sam:** This is a starting draft for your dad to work from. Fill in your parents' names, adjust the personal details, and let him make it his own. The tone should feel like *them* — warm, genuine, parent-to-parent.

Dear [Kailu's parents' names],

We hope this letter finds you and your family well. We're writing to introduce ourselves properly — we are Sam's parents, [first names], and we've wanted to reach out to you for some time now.

Over the past few years, we've watched our son grow in ways that we know are because of Kailu. The way he talks about her — her warmth, her intelligence, her patience, the life they're building together in New York — it's clear to us that she is someone truly special. We feel very fortunate that she is in his life, and we want you to know that she has become part of our family in our hearts already.

We understand that Sam will be visiting China soon and spending time in Chongqing with your family. We wish very much that we could be there in person. Even though we're here in Minnesota, please know that our home and our family are always open to you. We would love nothing more than to meet you — whether that means a trip to China or welcoming you here in the States, or wherever our paths can cross.

We know that family means everything — to you, and to us. We raised Sam to value the people he loves, to work hard, and to build something meaningful with his life. We're proud of who he's become, and we believe that so much of the person he is today comes from the love and support he's found with Kailu.

We look forward to the day we can sit together, share a meal, and get to know each other as family. Until then, we send our warmest regards and gratitude for raising such a wonderful daughter.

With respect and warm wishes,

[Sam's parents' names]

## Notes for Sam

**What to customize:**
- Your parents' first names (and however they'd like to sign)
- Kailu's parents' names (or a respectful address — ask Kailu what's appropriate)
- Any specific details your parents want to add (memories of meeting Kailu, things she's done for the family, etc.)
- Your dad's voice — he should rewrite parts that don't sound like him

**Cultural considerations:**
- Chinese families value sincerity, respect for family structure, and evidence that their daughter will be well cared for
- The letter doesn't need to explicitly mention proposals or marriage — the subtext is clear, and directness on that point should come from Sam in person
- If your parents want to include something about welcoming the family traditions or wanting to learn about their culture, that would resonate
- Translation: consider having Kailu translate it into Chinese (or get it professionally translated) so her parents can read it in their own language

**Logistics:**
- Get this to your dad by Monday (Feb 2) so he has time to write his version
- You leave Feb 11 — letter should be finalized before then
- Could be handwritten for extra warmth, or printed cleanly
- Kailu can help decide whether to send it ahead or present it in person`
