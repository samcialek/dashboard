# Cici's Wedding — Suit for Sam

## Context
- **Event:** Cici's wedding (during China trip, Feb 11+)
- **Dress code:** Qipao or Modern Chinese style (新中式)
- **Kailu:** wearing a colorful Qipao
- **Sam's measurements:** US size 38, medium shirt, slim build

## Sizing
Chinese menswear uses multiple sizing schemes:
- **S/M/L/XL** — same as Western. Sam = **M**
- **Height-based:** 165/170/175/180 (cm). Sam = **170/88A** (170cm height, 88cm chest)
- **Numeric (EU-ish):** 46/48/50. Sam = **48**
- **US suit size 38** — yes, this is used on Taobao too. Equivalent to M

⚠️ Always check the store's specific size chart (尺码表). Chest, shoulder width, and sleeve length matter most for slim fits. Measure a well-fitting jacket Sam already owns.

## What Kailu Sent (3 Taobao Screenshots)
All are 中山装 (Zhongshan suits) — the classic modern Chinese formal style with mandarin/stand-up collar. Black is dominant.

## Recommendation
For a **slim medium guy at a Chinese wedding**: go with the **Romon (¥105) or 衣林冠 (¥350)**. Both have huge buyer numbers meaning reliable sizing. The Romon is absurdly cheap for how popular it is. The 衣林冠 is the safe quality pick.

Tell Kailu: **order size M (or 170/88A)**, and check the size chart for chest ~96cm, shoulder ~43-44cm.

Black is the safe move and matches the Zhongshan suit tradition. Since Kailu is wearing a colorful Qipao, Sam in clean black creates nice contrast.
