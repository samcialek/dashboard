# LinkedIn Bio Draft — "Gestalt + Engines"

*Feb 1 2026. Concept: broad/accessible, centered on mastering online systems for decision-making, incorporating the gestalt and the engines from Statistical Rethinking.*

## About Section

I build systems that help people and organizations make better decisions — not by collecting more data, but by understanding the causal structure underneath it.

Most analytics starts with the data and asks "what happened?" I'm more interested in inverting the question: what process *generated* this data, and what would happen if we intervened? That shift — from estimation to simulation, from correlation to cause — changes everything about how you build models, products, and teams.

The engine is simpler than it sounds: start with a story about how the world works, identify exactly what you need to learn, build a model that extracts that answer honestly (including what it doesn't know), and update continuously as new evidence arrives. Bayesian workflow, causal inference, hierarchical structure — these are the moving parts. But the real skill is seeing the gestalt: not staring at individual metrics in isolation but grasping the whole architecture that produced them.

I've applied this lens across quant finance (D.E. Shaw), building decarbonization ($1M DOE SBIR grant at Maalka), real estate analytics (matrices.earth), and now health AI (Serif) — where we use causal models to separate what actually drives health outcomes from what merely correlates with them. The domains change; the engine doesn't.

I write about generative models, simulation, and decision-making at matricesofconfusion.com.
