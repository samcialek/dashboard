hey coal Bandits welcome to the hi coal Bandits this episode is special for two reasons and that's why I decided to record this intro in person first this is the last guest episode in the first season of the coal Bandits podcast it has been an incredible journey so far we've published 23 episodes recorded in 13 different locations across the globe we visited Europe Asia and Americas and over the last 10 months the podcast gained over 30,000 views and over 1,300 subscribers on YouTube and last month we crossed 1,300 monthly downloads on podcast platforms and I want to personally thank you for being here and supporting this podcast it means a lot to me the second reason why this episode is special is the guest his work has pretty literally changed the course of my life and I'm honored and Incredibly grateful for an opportunity to record this conversation with him at his home in Los Angeles ladies and gentlemen to anybody who knows something about modern causality he needs no introduction he loves history philosophy and music and I believe it's fair to say that he's the Godfather of modern causality ladies and Gentlemen please welcome Professor Juda Pearl ladies and Gentlemen please welcome Professor Juda pear all right hi everybody good to be with Alex here great Yuda thank you so much I'm super grateful uh for our meeting today and before we start I wanted to tell you that your Works uh pretty literally changed my the direction of My Life um because the book of why was where were you before where well before so I will tell you in a second I just wanted to share with you that I'm really grateful for for your work in particular for for the book of why because this is how my um my adventure with modern causality has started how has this started for you what causality yes I I have anecdote on that but in the junior class in high school our teacher for tried to introduce us to the wonders of logic he wanted to to motivate us here is a logical problem a logical Paradox that can be Rectify only if you have the tools of logic if you don't have it you fall into conclusions how did it motivate us he told us a story about the small Pucks in 1840 in France where they started vaccination vaccinating people and then they discover that the number of people that buy because of the vaccination itself is larger than the number of people that died out of um small pars so people start protesting maybe we should ban the vaccination not realizing that actually the data Prov the opposite that the vaccination is effective the reason why so few people died because of small parts was because the vaccination was successful so they fell into this kind of wrong conclusion so he was going to show us that logic has the power formally to rectify your Paradox but he didn't that motivated us and you all all Enchanted only later on in when I did artificial intelligence I tried to work out this problem to see if the tools of logic could turn out straight they didn't because there was not any language in which to say number of people that died from how do you say died from MH there's no way to say it how you you can count the number of people who are dead but from a certain factor it's hard to formulate in the tools available at that time so that was fascinating to me and I was looked for the language in which we can formulate it and took a long time only recently we have actually correct solution for this problem given the number of people member of people what can you say about the effectiveness of the vaccination so yeah but what motivation but uh I would say that recently speaking from the time I've been working in artificial intelligence the challenge of causality only came in the 1980s so after my book on ban Network came out which was purely probalistic you know I already knew that I'm missing something mhm I was saying that the uh managing uncertainty with Bean rules is the top the best way to handle things but I understood that the success of beijan network came from a different Source it came from from the simple uh reason that beij Network are constructed in the Cal Direction and not counter to it and that was the secret of their success mhm so I I felt already that I'm missing something in the 19 1988 when the book came out and I already felt that I need to go in different direction mhm yeah and that was the time when you realized that bason networks are not enough and you moved into the formalism of structural Cal models the structural came later in 1991 I believe that when Thomas Verma and I tried to to formulize in bulky and formulize counterfactuals with deterministic functions you deterministic where the um uncertainty comes only when the boundary conditions are uncertain namely the U variables or the error variables but everything deterministic and it was for us it was a trauma because we constantly we worked for two decades on probabilistic reasoning everything was stochastic and here we are formulating everything in deterministic functions it took some time to convince ourself we are on the right track mhm the teacher the physics teacher that you mentioned yeah it turns out that he was also a teacher of Daniel canaman who passed away recently that's two weeks ago and Daniel just mentioned to me in I think in the last year he WR me a message and said he read this anecdote about the teacher and the name is not coincidental because we also had a teacher named Fang by the way forer the same family of Leon fanger who was a very successful um author in Germany uh at that time and uh also it's a very huge it's a huge family has many branches I worked in my a summer job in the uncle of for also oh he was a electrical contractor mhm he used to wire a public institution wire the electricity to public institution and I work there as a cable Pooler MH yeah so many connections for for but interesting thing was Daniel also had the same teach and we started talking about our teacher how good they were and they were really something that we look back we don't find teachers like that today you know a teacher can come to class and without any notes can talk about any topic whatsoever the uh the gross national product of Kamchatka okay about everything they they knew geography and economics andys physics and Mathematics it was really we were lucky how my generation was lucky to be part of this educational experiments speaking of of Daniel canaman his work uh was focused large part of his work was was focused his and ames's work on the biases and errors systematic errors in human in human reasoning when we think about intelligence from this perspective um we could probably hypothesize that there are some maybe evolutionary reasons for these errors to propagate uh in in humans do you think that an artificial intelligence General artificial intelligence system uh should be a system that always reason reasons correctly in formal sense Let It Be logically or or causally I don't know what the word should means uh MH we human are constrained by our resources we don't have the power to reason all the way so we reason quickly because we have to make decision quickly so we we are we building in shortcuts the shortcuts have errors in them by definition it's shortcut you didn't go and search all the way you didn't think of all the factors you find only the main factors and you make it decision that's it's Laden with errors and biases depends on the kind of shortcut you make you're talking about large machines they do not have this limitations in the resources so I don't know they may just not have those biases because they can afford to search deeper and come out with a more more reason conclusion unless they are limited by other things mhm they could be limited by the samples that they can access not everything is in the training set but it's a different kind of animal we new machine because they have different computational limitations than our than we do so that's why I hate to speculate we do not have the vocabulary or the metaphor to even begin to predict how they're going to behave in 10 years in your work um with with Al baren Bo you have demonstrated that we cannot learn certain structures model certain structures based solely on observational data when L language models appeared in the in the field they entered the field there was a debate that is still an ongoing debate uh regarding what those models can learn so some some people said hi they can actually learn World models other people said no it's impossible we know this from the uh causal hierarchy fance and so on now but when we look at this from a slightly different perspective for instance perspective proposed by Andrew linan from beep M uh he says those models can actually learn active causal strategies from passive data so he makes this distinction he says this is passive data which means some of this data is observational but some actually is Interventional because it describes experiments or some of this data is actually U maybe some interactions between people like in a discussion forum and so on and so on and so in his work he's he has shown that at least in simple cases uh a large language model Transformer based large language model can learn how to generalize causal causal reasoning what are your thinks about L what are your thoughts about llms today and and their limitations you you said you hate to speculate so I don't want to push you into speculation but um do you have any thoughts about the future as well the basic difference is that the llm large language models have a new kind of data in their training said it's not data the it comes from the environment it comes from people who wrote articles and these people have causal model of the world and so we can learn from their models we can just copy the model okay if you copy somebody's model of the world it doesn't mean you learn the model of the world from data you learn it from another person who had this model so therefore they are not tied or constrained by the ladder of cation okay actually access the data the data contains text produced by people who have model of the world so either you copy them but if you if it don't have a explicitly mat explicit matching between the query and then you compose them together by building a salad of associations among the causal model that were authored by people fine now we are working with the salad how the salad works I don't know it's a very strange kind of mixture and we have to experiment with as a black box a new black box M salad of rals a Sal of rumors yes about causal model yeah no that's a beautiful I love this I love this name um yeah so so so that's very interesting we have some papers showing that those models can perform pretty well on some czzle benchmarks and then they perform very very bad on other czzle benchmarks perhaps they haven't read benchmarks oh that's question the toy problem that I have in my book oh no people have like different like causal reasoning benchmarks nowadays so I don't love them I don't like them M because they are too big mhm what the covid-19 that's a benchmark you cannot you cannot handle you don't understand the data is so large he don't have a ground truth I like to work with the firing squad for variabl okay and simple question what if a Rifleman want refrain from shooting this is I understand what the ground truth what kind of answer I do expect so I can manipulate it and see under what condition it works well and when it doesn't MH so this is my Benchmark and I can tell you the story that how I experiment with llms on the firing squad problem MH first it tells me f Squad it's it's illegal to shoot in California M that was first thing to be you have to be very careful when you start firing and so I said forget about it let's stop talking about Ming slowly slowly got the idea and he told me yeah if you're telling me that the rif man listens only to the captain and if you tell me keep on all repeating the Assumption even though the Assumption were derivable already from the story mhm it he said if this is this is this is is true then then you're right if Riflemen when refrain from shoot shooting the prisoner will still be dead if you prompt it more and more and tell but you have already the answer why do you have to repeat eventually it get it right so it's really an exercise and prompting you're dealing with a black box and you're asking what kind of prompt will give you the answer that you expect here we know what answer we expect in big problem we don't know the answer we expect so I like to experiment with the firing squad yeah so there's actually one Benchmark that uh Builds on top of this kind of uh this kind of approach it was proposed by jiing Jing and Bernal shilov and other offers they build basically an engine that generates stories like this like the fire yeah with with the grand truth as well and they generate stories on the assoc on each of the ranks of the Le of conation yeah the stories comes in the form of elements factors objects that we are understanding our everyday life or comes in the form of a variable variable X variable why and just Nam of variables or names that mean something to a baby that's a great question because it turns out that large language models perform much much poorer if we use variables instead of OB objects that objects yeah yeah yeah which in a sense it's similar to humans human which means that they have the baby world ER under control if you could advise causal Community today on choosing the directions for research for the next 5 10 years what what would that be personalized medicine I individualized decision making cuz we we have done some recent work you know with Scott it's something we didn't think is feasible five years ago and now we see that we can answer questions about probability of harm and quantifying harm is very important in medicine as I told you in the lecture it's also important in political science yeah quantifying benefit swing States and things everywhere in the business and marketing yeah you always make a decision on a particular situation specific and you want to compare doing it versus not doing it to this particular setup m not population but this particular setup so we have now the means of answering situation specific question and that is should be put into use some practitioners um referring to to your works with with Scott say that it might be difficult in certain cases to sample from population yeah to get the observational data they sample from population at random or or representatively actually they argue that when you sample from population it's a different kind of population than the one which on which you experiment mhm because in order to get to experiments you have to have all kind of condition parents agreement and um you have to sign papers and you're being incentivized by payment or by good treatment the people who have selected for randomiz control trial are different kind of people than those that you can get on a telephone book yeah so that is maybe correct but for many in many exercises you get both population or both experimental and observ ational data from the same population for instance if you are doing a caal discovery and you have a graph the graph generates for you the observational data that's P of XYZ together with the Interventional data which you can get by the do operator on the graph you have in the same population in same mathematical object yeah can generate both when you have both and you can narrow the bound bounds and get good bounds informative bounds on individual Behavior yeah I think this is a very very promising um Direction what do you think is the cause of the rift that we have in the causal community so we have people uh who are maybe coming from your tradition raical tradition and identification how there any anyone else well there are trialists right they TR there in epidemology and people and economics and you know I must say that from my perspective I see today that more and more people are using graphs there there's virtually no one who has who is not using graphs today uh but still there are those different traditions and different modes of thinking and sometimes people in those different subcommunities are just speaking different language using different language speaking about the very same thing the very same issue and this is problematic I think because we lose the efficiency of research they cannot communicate yeah sometimes we duplicate work yes exactly and sometimes we just uh object to each other results on the basis of misunderstanding what the results are yeah yeah so what what can I say we have a few things that we should consult and the theorem says that the potential outcome framework is logically equivalent to the structural causal models and which means that ethereum in one framework is also a theum in another an assumption in one framework is can be articulated as an assumption in in the other framework so it's a logical equivalence the only difference is whether you feel comfortable articulating your assumption or your knowledge in general yeah in one language or another and it so happens that I feel more comfortable and everybody that I know feel more comfortable even people who are doing potential outcome feel more comfortable they're actually doing Pro they're doing graphs in their mind and they put down equations to pacify the reviewers in their field because no one can think in terms of conditional ignorability oh you can you can put down assumption in conditional probability format without even thinking whether it is defensible or not because it helps you get the equation get the identification right okay so you can do that and many many are doing that but when you come down to ask your question can I defend this conditional ignorability assumption uh that it makes sense in my setup I don't know of any mortal that can answer this question youa what do you think is the next the next thing in artificial intelligence where where should we where where where should we look everybody is looking at large language models now no matter what I say people are going to play large language mod which is fascinating I'm using them too you know for the purpose yeah they help me uh improve my text when I write papers and they allow me to find new uh metaphors I can ask you can ask it give me some poetical expression for this idea that's beautiful whether and we know how to if you coming from causal inference we know how to use large language model to benefit but with our functional approximator and once we can express the answer to our qu in a collection of functions we know what engines will approximate those function on the basis of sampling from data yeah and we know how to put it together the theory tells you how you put together expression from one one do expression from another do expression or probability probabilistic equation so we know how to compose them so there is a hybrid of qu influence and large language model that we we know how to handle today what's the future is going to be how to speculate I really don't know but we have many areas which automatically are begging to be explored um automatic automatic scientists MH the scientist that can decide on the best experiment to conduct next because there is a dilemma in theory free will it's another thing which I I touched on in the last chapter of the book of why which I think will be solved solved I mean solved to the to the satisfaction of all the philosophers that call it the Cur of science or Scandal sorry Scandal of science that's what Phil it's going to be solved because the the illusion of Free Will evidently has some survival value it's otherwise we wouldn't obtain this we wouldn't get hooked on this illusion for so many decades so many centuries evidently it has a survival value when we exercise intelligence machine of a large number of environments eventually those who will have the illusion of free will Will Survive and will overcome the others right so and we learn what is the computational advantage of this illusion and then we can program it m and what will be the answer there will be computer system that act as though they have a free will even though they are just newal firing so they don't have free will yeah but they will act as though they have free will and they will understand us when we talked about our free will yeah so it'll be be a trustable system you mentioned the the idea of the automated scientist sometime ago just a couple of weeks ago I had a conversation with a person from one of the National Labs here in the US and they told me that they cannot anymore afford using brute force in scientific experimentation they they do stuff in chemistry physics and so on they the fall to do what Brute Force which means like just do this experiment do that experiment you know so so they want something smarter and the idea of automated scientist is something that they are looking for and now some of the people that are trying to to construct automated scientist like this today one of the challenges that they face is that it's difficult somehow to encode in a model like this the the the all the possible the entire possible space of starting points another thing is that they say that it's difficult to make the model understand which direction it should go into I don't understand it okay what is the input what is the output I think like engineer know I was electrical engineer great question so I understand that the input is is some knowledge that we have today yeah and some measurements that are coming from different measurement systems and then what I'm what I know people are trying to do for instance is to use some kind of bean optimization like a gsan process or something like this in order to to look for another feasible hypotheses let's take an example I don't cannot think in in generality you believe that malaria is caused by bad air from Swamp okay what does it I don't no but we used to believe yes course that's the has the name right right Mal Mal and eventually we came up to the conclusion no it was a mosquito called anilus that whose bite transfer removed from one model to another is that a good example of what they're looking for yeah I think so I think that would be a good mod yeah so in this case the survival value ni in either taking a mosquito net or taking an air mask which which is going to be more effective when you go to the swamp yeah we have a survival value one model begs a different act preventive action than another one is correct and one is not how one can um learn it or hypothesize that might be some something else I think the way to go about it is local perturbation on existing model MH you have a a link between going to the swamp and malaria and you ask is there any intermediate variable that we can intervene on this is a general scheme okay so now we're going to experiment with different intervening variables okay what could it be local perturbation on the model is something which corresponds to it's a TOA example of changing Paradigm but it it it might just work from this local perturbation you can test one by another and U outome the correct model or the invention of the vitamin C yeah link experiment so I understand what you're saying is that we can come up with a hypothesis to intervene on the existing Str hypothesis on the existing model that we have yes um and then basically perform a simple experiment right and see what the intervention leads to to what changes in the outcome um sometimes I think though that might be difficult in the malaria example you know we have somebody fought at one day hey there are mosquitoes there maybe we can you know change something related to the mosquitoes and this lead this person to design the intervention that turned out to make sense for all of us today but sometimes we just don't know we might not know probably depending on the case you might not know what is the set of possible interventions so like which subset of all possible interventions we should look look through what are your thoughts on this um it has to be situation specific of course if you see mosquitoes then the hypothesis is generated perhap there something to the mosquito but you also see other things you see green grass in the swamp right so maybe the green grass yeah so and then comes the power of metaphors we know that mosquitoes are capable of doing certain things in green is not capable of certain things and there is also the germ theory of disease that comes into play and we are able to put it all all this together the systems that we have now are not capable metaphor is another powerful Reason by analogy it's another powerful mode that has not been tackled in artificial intelligence it it sounds to me resembles um to me the idea of a affordances like the object has something when we look at I look at a chair I already think what I can do with the chair yes yeah there's like a lot of contextual knowledge that I bring into the scene what do you think are the main blockers today that stop us from as a community applying causality more broadly in Industry there there are many blockage funding is one uh language is another training is the third one lack of platforms you can mention but I think mainly it's attention MH people do not pay attention to the limitations which are predicted by causality or by the virtue of the knowledge that we acquired in causal reasoning if I talk to machine learning person you wouldn't know what I'm talking about everything is sampling um interpolations care fitting and everything is in the data it's a barrier it's a big barrier it's a it's a matter of changing Paradigm MH and as Thomas K so keenly said you can't expect people to change Paradigm every 10 years and now we have to change it every 10 years and people are paid and they are rewarded by continuing to work in the same Paradigm and they are paid to continue that and not to change it so you can't expect them to um change language look at all the satis they are still doing regression I know at least one statistician that doesn't agree with your with your diagnosis because he said no real statisticians causal modeling has been our uh guideline from day one from Fisher right and we are doing it okay fine you pick up a statistics book and show me in the index the world cause you wouldn't find it yeah I mean I mean I agree with you in in in principle you know when I had statistics classes for instance we were we were learning about sem structural equation models right yeah so this is a model that can represent causality in general at least in certain cases some modification some variations of those models and so on there still a journal of stru equation model right yeah but the way I was taught I was Tau it so well my first question was like okay so this is we have some covariance matrices fitting and some blah blah blah and some other statistical stuff which is well it is very important but how how is it different from any other statistical method that was my question how do I know if I fit this model to one structure versus another structure which which one should I pick and what I was Tau in my classes was that whichever has better fit to the data which is bason information criteria measure as by Bas information criteria or something like this but this is a terrible advice actually and we know that we can build a statistical model fited to codal data in a way that is not correct and get actually better fit to the data than a causal model the thing is that the non-causal fit will generalize will not generalize under distribution shift right and the other one will so so in this sense I agree with you that I think we need a shift in education as well or maybe primarily we need shift in in in education how we teach people every college has a statistic Department not every college has a the causal influence Department if you just change it to wow statistics should be a special Cas a special branch of causal influence that's dealing with the lower level of the of the ladder I'm not saying it's simpler it's it's a lot of intricate questions you can ask about efficiency of estimators and things of that s within the level but you should have in mind the entire ladder so you can move and ask reasonable meaningful by the way when I looked into a structural equation model the answer that I got was it's a parsimonious representation of the cence Matrix which also is Meaningful let's put the answer again for Peter bentler MH who is the author of several book in structural equation model okay so the answer was what is structural equation model it's a parsimonious representation of the covariance Matrix nothing else but it's also meaningful why is Meaningful the word cation did not appear it's meaningful because it represent your causal model your knowledge yeah what we call knowledge is really not just data it's data plus the ropes behind the data that is caal model structure then so that is what makes it meaningful you you that the last uh keynote presentation during this year's clear conference that took place here nearby at the UCLA campus your campus was by Elizabeth Tipton and she talked about her experience with so-called evidence-based framework that heavily relies on r control control trials she gave some examples very ey openening examples from the field of education and interventions in schools and one of the challenges that she talked about was that although there were randomized control trials behind the interventions people didn't want to use those interventions because they were asking a question how how does this apply to my particular school so they understood that there was some intervention but they were not convinced that the results of this intervention can be translated to their to their to their use case and I found it very interesting and we know that we have some results from your work and and your students work that can help us translating such interventions to particular cases at least in certain cases they are right in the sense that in order to use our method the method of data Fusion taking result of several randomized experiment and applying them to a new environment okay using the idiosyncratic characteristic of your new environment yeah that relies on assumptions it relies on on on having the graph which means it relies on level two assumptions which are not all of them are verifiable by randomized experiment so they can say we don't believe that okay we just believe randomiz experiment but we cannot apply it from one environment to another MH and what we are saying is there are people people are sometimes are capable of characterizing idiosyncratic properties of their environment and if you you can do that formally then you can transfer information from other experiment to your environment that is a tradeoff here evidently people do not use what is available in other experiment they they simply they it's a waste okay so and people have a very good idea of what's special about the environment okay like we have homeless so we have whatever character is so they have to model it and then but they have to be familiar with the art of modeling and these people are so are not are not trained in causal influence so they are not familiar with the available technique I made this point on in my comments to Deton and CWI uh paper on the limitation of randomized experiments we do have today tools for combining experiments yeah as you said um maybe there's a challenge again in how we teach people about causal inference so in a statistic in a traditional statistics course you you will get at least an overview of what a an RCT is and so on but often we teach people that rcts are the golden standard for establishing cation and we are not talking about the limitations of of rcts not saying hey um this is the the rank two right this is the Interventional questions this devices can answer Interventional questions but not counterfactual questions and so then it it causes a lot of confusion because people some people do not distinguish between ranks two and three and the areas where they need level three immediate areas where they need is to find causes of effect you are having you know you see the effect and you ask what could be the factors that account for it okay um and then we go to the question of um uh direct cause versus indirect cause a distinction between um necessary cause and sufficient cause necessary and sufficient CA all these quantities that answer the question about causes of effect those are beyond the reach of statisticians who are only interested in randomized experiments they simply cannot answer and I give you a simple example of um having a drug which um has no effect but you don't know if the no effect randomized experiment can show no effect you don't know if the no effect means no effect of every any individual or kill some and Save some yeah kill 10% and say randomized experiment will not be able to distinguish between the two model but we have tools today to distinguish with them for instance tools that combine observational studies and randomized experiment from these two you can get right away bounds on the probability of harm probability of benefit for each individual yeah so it's they missing the people who are are blind to level three are missing on those questions and we know exactly what questions they are missing on yeah MH some of them will tell you we don't need this level we don't want we never want I Reuben wrote in one place C of effect he said it's for cocktail party it's not scientific oh yeah because you can always go what is the cause you go to the go you go to the big bang okay so it's a cocktail party question it's not well but we have Mark of blankets and all this stuff right we don't need to go infinitely far look there are questions simple question I'll give you the possible code ask you to what degree is it a sufficient cause like the bat for criteria for legal in legal setting would the injury be okay but for the actions of the accused it's a question which is constantly ask in legal setting and we have the answer for it we have a way of formulating it we know under what condition we can identify it what kind of data we need to do that so the tools are available the education is missing I don't think they teach it in law school schs okay even in law schools that have the audacity of um appealing to statistical method for answering question and some of the lawyers are interested those lawyers are still unaware of the available Tools in in Cal INF frence I must say I want to give you something that is a little bit more optimistic than what you said I got an email from a lawyer who was actually talking about probability of necessity and probability of sufficiency and he asked me for a review of his of his work terrific so it happens it happens maybe slowly but uh but happens it will take time I I hope they it the Advent of the large language model does not uh cover the results in inference sometime it may cover and it may expose them MH cover in a sense that bury them bury them yeah with attention going into last language model rather than to cause INF which is the foundation of knowledge I hope it not covers it but it exposes it and amplifies it hopefully I think many people are getting more and more aware about the limitations of FL language models and the questions when they ask the questions how to improve them they inevitably go into causal questions the causal question give you the framework the kind of question you can answer the tools are available we know so much about human knowledge because of the caal influence results this is our own knowledge so in every aspect that requires the user interface with the machine you have to take into account the user structure of of knowledge and that's where it's going to play a role do you think we will find or discover methods to automatically and efficiently learn user knowledge somehow you learn user knowledge yeah instead of you know encoding it I think so yeah it's just another environment if you can model environment why shouldn't we model the user it's another Black Box yeah not a set of variables contextual VAR yeah mhm so before we finish I would like to do something new so I sing We can sing at the end I'm happy to um so before I came here I published on LinkedIn and Twitter a question to people if they could ask you one question what would that question be and so I've just checked and there are some comments from people so I would like to read maybe one or two questions from them okay okay so one question comes from subaj Das from Amazon and he asks about the access to data and he says the access to data grows and AI is becoming more polished than ever and his question to you is if you think that the day is near when true causality can be established with lesser assumptions or is it the other way so I understand that he asks he says like we have so much data now I don't think data can make up for assumptions data just gives you data in the astoic case assuming that you have infinite data so what do we have probability distribution right and most of the work we we in CA influence we assume already condition distribution or the distribution right join distributions okay so the limitation that we found are limitation in the asymptotic case when you have infinite data the kind of data that you get makes a difference but not the size so that would be what we discussed before right before you cannot go from level one to level two if you have infinite data or of observation only mhm passive observation yeah so this is about what is the content of the data rather than the size of the absolutely but for how was the data obtained yeah great let's see another one Andy Wilson asks about causal Discovery what do you think about causal Discovery software he always got the sense that your Crusade was that causal Discovery shouldn't exist but it also seems promising not shouldn't exist I simply I focus my work on the question on a different question not how to discover it but assum if you have it what can you do with it div vision of work I let the CMU people continue the ca of the I watch it once in a while achievement and the the Improvement that they came up with and I know there have been a lot of uh recent Improvement um making the assumptions less uh stringent and others but um I just focus on what can we do with it instead of what how to discover it I look you have to have a division of labor beautiful okay some people just ask you question why I think silent would be the best answer if you don't articulate your query don't expect the qu the answer I I live it without a comment okay so now we have also some questions from Twitter how will causality be learned by Future AGI in the same way that we learn it now the same way people learn it and look at all the Avenues where we can learn what does it mean to learn Cal model right when it's three levels same way we learn it SEC level two is learn by experiment level three is learn by hypo hypothesizing um hypothesis and Imagination um we we have the structure for that so I hope it will learn by the same way that people learn it like the way that scientists learn it and I think we're doing very well in science except it will be accelerated because we'll have a great access on on data and and computation the last question that we have here comes from Boris SV I know him from Vancouver why bother with d based identification instead of focusing or on a more accurate specification of scms but what's the difference I mean dag is just the abstraction ofm so why focus on a d you mean level two identification yeah I understand I understand so I understand why to only focus on Dax so the structure rather than a richer specification of scms it IAS just give me paper on identification in level three and so I have I haven't read it yet good we will link to this paper in the show description so everybody can refer to it what can you identify in level three the functions themselves yeah seems that that's the additional part of information that we get there right but since we don't have a way of testing it uh well we have bounds on them that's good no we you're right we have like combining experimental on experimental data we have bounds on queries from level three so yeah we can learn to the extent that the bounds allow you to learn especially when you when the bound collapsed into a point estimates yeah which happens sometimes which happens sometimes yes and we know when that's a nice thing yeah that's a great thing that's true Yuda what question would you like to ask me that's a tough one what what did you do before you got into K influence into C inference so were you happy well um I have an additional dimension of excitement today but what what I did so um well I was doing stuff related to Psychology and Neuroscience and before that I was a musician and a music producer oh that's what made you play the piano that's that's where you play the piano yes that's good so we can end it with a good song [Laughter] [Music] shalal [Music] that was beautiful it's a beautiful good song It's a Beautiful song absolutely I wanted to ask you two more questions before we finish okay the first one is who would you like to thank my teachers in high school mhm and in college that always gave us the uh illusion that we can be contributing scientist we are not just users of science but makers of science yeah that each one of us can contribute something it's a it's a great gift mhm for me yeah so that's one thing that I want go else like could mention 100 people my students who pushed me into areas that didn't want to go to against my will and um they taught me many new things and um what they say in the mission I learned a lot from my teacher but more so for my students thank you what constitutes a good life I think it's the illusion that you are part of a chain and it comes in different level I see myself in the part of a chain okay it was a big giants Aristo and all this and I little old I added the pebble though good that's good life and the same thing goes for the family right my grandfather gave to my father I give to my children and that's is it's illusion of being a link in a chain but it gives some meaning meaning to life and finding something today that I didn't know yesterday it's even it it had L to the chain MH what would be your advice for people who are just starting with something complex and they see that there's so much to learn maybe they're starting with mathematics or machine learning or physics or causality I don't know I would quit I would not start something which looks too complex I find with something that I feel that I can contribute something that I master at Le part of it and from this little part I can expand but I wouldn't get into an area which is too complex MH like for in I don't know genetics and I find it very hard to get into it's too complex don't know how to get into I I quit so that be start small with something if I at least one tiny areas of genetic relationship it I can relate to it I really understand from there I can grow bigger I can expand beautiful it was a pleasure you there thank you so much well thank you Alex thank you it was also fun
