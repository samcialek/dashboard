you need to know what you want to know and you need the prize for this and identification scheme can give you both I want to completely encourage you to drop this fear hey causal Bandits welcome to the causal Bandits podcast the best podcast on causality and machine learning on the internet today we traveling to Munich to meet our guest his parents advised him not to take much risk but he had other ideas he was a child experimentor torn between chemistry physics and electrical engineering during his studies he Mo deeply into information Theory to fall in love with causality a few years later he loves connecting with others and has an unparalleled drive for Innovation ladies and gentlemen Mr Daniel even her let me pass it to your host Alex molac welcome to the podcast Daniel thank you for having me I'm very happy that you were able to join us today Daniel I want to start with a very particular question in your opinion what is the problem with the current approach to autonomous driving that there is actually no Approach at all I mean there is a theory that you basically need to drive millions of kilometers to basically get all the events in a natural environment possible and that's simply not feasible and you can break it down with simulation but simulation has complexity issues has issues to build it up properly and yeah something is missing there there is a gaping Gap to frame it how could we address this Gap in your opinion I think there is a framework you're probably as you looking in this podcast or maybe are new to this topic is uh basically like I don't know the English expression but in Germany we would say it's the best match it's like I grabbing obvious to use use uh caal models use a model which basically has all the distributions of natural things appear and you model and play around with this distributions and answer queries So my answer is we should look into the direction of caal models is it because caal models are more efficient in describing the the parameter space uh exactly and there is another property of course you can incorporate the time into Cal models uh but for this time is a problematic if you can keep time out of your equation then you're much more efficient cuz you uh when time sometimes time is obvious that it has an impact for example when you go with your autonomous driving function and have a camera into a tunnel then you have the logical sequence of okay it's light then it's dark and then it's light again and this exact time sequence can make a difference but for other things time doesn't play a role so you can more often than not take time out of your equation and just have to distribution of natural events and can combine them in yeah in a mechanism to to use this words so you can use functions you can use complex functions you can use machine learning neural networks to to model these things and that you don't need to do it real time or even a speed up real time like in simulation you can combine the parameter SP space much more efficient I would say in short how did your journe into kazal start basically I got uh interested like so many with judia pear so here was the first I read about and he has this uh you know special um desire and burn inside which catched me basically to say hi I have problems there I mean problems throughout the industry who are not solved and this is a framework which looks so much matching to to solve uh part or maybe all of this problems we have I need to look into it it has testable implications so there was so many green flags to to go deeper and uh when I started to read the book of why uh you know I I read it in the evenings I read for many hours it was one of the books I you know when you are caught by something you read non-stop so you you like uh oh I'm happy for the next evening to to continue my journey so so how I got into this which parts of Pearl's framework were the most inspiring to you inspiring was that it's a framework uh which basically has testable implications uh so you are somehow on a safe ground uh the other thing was that it allows to have counterfactual things so you always experience the world in a factual way so you have some recordings of for example driving Maneuvers when it was sunny but at the same time maybe the what would have been if it would Rin so this counterfactual aspect with probability of necessity and sufficiency to go a bit deeper was immanent to see that yeah that could be a solution to broaden your tool set to to tackle this problems you mentioned counterfactuals do you think that counterfactuals are necessary to build autonomous agent let it be driving agents or what whatever other kind of agents that can act effectively in the world uh that's a a tricky question I I need to uh frame it a bit I I want to come from really the caal direction so we all know or probably most of uh you know the caal letter and in the Cal letter you have this associative this Interventional and this counterfactual uh Rank and it goes you know everything mentioned first incorporates uh is Incorporated in the Second Step so if you do counterfactual you incorporate Interventional and associative so you have have everything basically so uh to answer your question I want to say what is the difference between interventions and counterfactual so the difference is in interventions you are the manipulator you manipulate values to to certain values to make sure it is like this so you feed your caal model certain parameters and you say calculate me the outcome exactly in this way but by it is like this you mean making sure that the mechanism is is the way that we expected it to be uh you you fix the input of the mechanism and that can be good in scenarios but uh in complex scenarios with autonomous driving uh you are not sure for all your parameters to be fixed but you want to incorporate knowledge for you have from already observed data and when it comes to counterfactual you incorporate this knowledge so you made this abduction step you propagate your knowledge from an observation up to your background exogeneous they have many names this variables and you say how does the distribution shift under this observation and then only in the Second Step you forward your Cal model into this in this state you have uh set it through your observations and I think this is much more Mighty and more usable um then simply fixing some Interventional values to to certain values and and look for this parameter space but also to incorporate what you already know and I mean it's a unique step you need to do in in counterfactual queries Maybe could give our audience for those people who are not that familiar with counterfactual reasoning a short definition of what abduction is abduction is somehow uh upward propagation so you have your network you can imagine a tree Network for example and you have a observation on a variable which is way down in the tree so and so it's caused by something it's it's a child it's a child it's a child a grandchild a grandchild exactly it's the family anry basically when you think of the latest Heritage of a Heritage tree and uh he You observe something about about him for example he has blonde hair so you you want to up flow this knowledge into your uh distributions uh what could be I mean there is a distribution about to stay into this picture about his grandparents great grandparents they still can be any hair color but some phenotypes are more likely when this grandchild is blonde and you want to basically update this distributions of the hair color or phenotypes of of ancesters by this fact this doesn't mean that you set it to a single value so it's not necessary that all his grandparents need to be blond but the likelihood is shifted towards some phenotypes and and this is basically abduction we know that in order to compute contactual queries we might require a very rich description of the system a lot of information about the system how do you deal with this challenge in practice you came straight into the greatest problem for the industrial use of Cal models so you have basically a two laed um way you either spend a lot of engineering and um yeah time and effort and resources to make a full specified Cal model we use the structural Cal model framework because it incorporates any uh functional relationship you can think about it so it's the most general of course it needs also the highest effort to fully fully specified structural caution model with all the mechanisms distributions you need and you can either go there you can decide okay we we want to go there then we are sure to answer any counterfactual query so when you once decided that you have you're not specific you need to answer many questions and you are not sure what it is then you will need to go this way or maybe you can strip way a bit so this means that what you're saying I understand as if we want something very general in the future we need to put a lot of work today in order to make these guarantees for the future and then you can be go on another Branch you can say I'm very specific I have two three questions I want to get answer to and I will sit down make a deck structure and then we have an algorithm it's called the identification algorithm it's the ID IDC ID star IDC star and this algorithms they can give you a simple answer you just need to sit down and have the structure and then they will tell you you can answer your question or you can't so it's um and then uh it tells you a second thing when it's answerable so when the question it's identifiable uh to so say uh this term then it will give you basically uh also the recipe how to c calculate the query how to calculate the query and in this case you can tell your boss we need to collect data for this and this and that variable and then we can answer you the query of course this can be maybe too cumbersome to collect all this data then maybe more often than not maybe you ask a too difficult question and maybe a decision can be done by a much easier question and then we can maybe um you know model the question so that the effort outcome ratio is much more more better for you so there is you can play with it you can say okay this question may be too hard too many data let's ask a smaller easier question less data okay that's maybe in a step for a first step if this question is negative we don't need to know the more difficult question right because we are already done bring brings me to mind um this idea of computing optimal decisions when it comes to the effort the energy span and gain we expect to gain from Computing a given quantity so this is something that we are also familiar with in science especially engineering definitely yeah I I think I think to the capability to ask the right questions is half the goal right so if you know what you want to know and if you know the price for each of these questions so a scientist he wants to know something how much data he needs to collect how much studies I think of Hol uh for example he traveled the half half the world and collected so much data cuz he he was curious to know something so you need to know what you want to know and you need the price for this and identification scheme can give you both is your question answerable and how much is the effort to to get an answer with your team you have been working on on a very interesting project for some time already can you tell us a little bit more about this project yeah it's started all in July 2020 uh not everybody is very uh warm to remember but it was in the heights of Corona time so uh was lockdown we had a meeting on the rooftop teras keep distance and everything and we started a public funded project so it's half uh funded by the Bavarian Ministry of economy and half by by my company EFS and uh we were asking following question uh to make uh this autonomous driving function safe don't need to test you know the vanilla basic tests but you need really need to get into Corner cases uh Corner case is a a test case where where at least two parameters coincide and they coincide so that not each of this parameters necessarily an extreme value but by coinciding by a middle value of air pressure and a middle value of temperature something happens which only you know when they came together by coincide you mean that they interact with each other they interact with each other and they make something which is problematic so each parameter alone is a piece of cake but when they interact with each other like for example rain and temperature there can be a lot of rain the street is okay for the um Wheels there can be a low temperature and dry no problem but when it's minus one Dee and slight rain then then you have a a problem those Corner cases what made you pay attention to them it came from my uh job at this point I was test manager for autonomous driving function SAE level three and later SAE level four and there is exactly this question where are this uh test cases we missing at some point and what what is the corner cases so and I S using the Cal framework using the queries and using the probability of necessity The Joint probability necessity and the joint probability of sufficiency can give a real uh can guide the answer the team you are currently working with is a very diverse team how how is it to work with people with such different backgrounds on something as fundamental as causal learning or causal reasoning it's a a pleasure I can say uh it's in some meaning very diverse in other meaning it's not so diverse so we have uh PhD Physicians uh physis physicist par physicist we have mathematicians they all have this you know um logical mindset um to to tackle problems in in some different flavors but we are diverse because we have um also uxix UI designers who ask completely different question question uh we have uh luckily uh a good mixture of uh female and male uh team members who you know uh give their strengths in so when it comes to strengths we have a a very multi modal to say it like this team yeah what what are the main strengths that physicists are bringing to the table and mathematicians are bringing to the table I I think that's that's a very good question because they bring exactly some opposite side characteristics uh pH physicists are used to think critical and openminded so for them nothing is a complete rule but they try to challenge and you know there is this principle uh some a theory in physics is only true if you can't uh falsify it so so you know they put everything on the table and say nothing is granted and this is very good to be explorative to you know not shy back and and go in Uncharted Territory on the other hand mathematicians they want their solid mathematical framework they want something which is proof which is you know which you can write down which is not such a crazy idea like I confront my colleagues sometimes with and they ask immediately uh what's the proof where is the paper I can read this what is the background so this uh and and this plays well together uh cuz it's uh you know fruit F to have some explorative minds and to have Minds which bring you back to you know uh to the translation into mathematics and into algorithms because in the end a fluffy idea doesn't bring you any any algorithm Daniel you mentioned physicists uh physicists are often accustomed with experimental work and this experimental work often involves iterations so we planned something maybe it didn't work we want to try again changing something we changed something and we want to try again I had a very interesting conversation with some of my guests and they emphasized that this iterative culture is substantial to their work with with causal models in re reality what is your your view on this I couldn't agree more actually uh when you work with caal methods sooner or later you need a benchmark example you need something uh which is understandable and you know we all know the Spector and front graphs where you have X Y four notes and some meaning uh but we needed a benchmark model which is a bit more complex than this but at the same time we want to use it as a communication thing to show others hey that's the outcome of of our worker this could be and we were thinking about you know we made a doen Time the ice cream example on our slides but we wanted to say something more difficult more difficult but at the same time comprehensible and then we started to think yeah we are working on autonomous driving what can we do let's make a lane changing assistant so we interviewed I think 30 plus people what is the influencing factors about Lane changing we came across everything it's you know the lanes simply disappears so you need to change to um yeah uh the one beforehand you is uh slower than you and you want to overtake him so there are many influencing factors and we worked hours and hours I think we worked 150 200 cumulated hours and we had a huge model which is uh you need basically a textbook to to explain this model so you can easily it's more it's easier to get pound l with 100 plus notes then to you know contract yourself and and look at the very minimal so what's iterative on this uh so you easily end up with very uh huge models and you need to ask what really I want to model what what is the thing and you you need to first I mean there is in many directions iterative workflow you need to think about what I do I want to know then you need to can iterate over the structure uh you need to incorporate all the structural information cuz as we all know when you have a link a missing link is a stronger indication than a link when there is a link between two variables because in the end you can set it to zero so there's no impact so with the structure you need to integrate with the mechanisms so mechanisms don't fall easily I had a conversation with a colleague and he said oh it's so depressing this mechanisms uh this is so difficult to to model them to get the data so you won't have an easy way to to have everything at once and you just need to think what is the first goal I can make I can make a substructure I can make a Frankenstein structure like I call it where you put pieces together which ah it's not perfectly suiting but maybe it comes a step closer so iterate so caution models imply iterative mindset I think yeah it it sounds to me like one of those aspects that is important to you in your work is to build a prototype first a prototype idea and then try to find out which elements of this prototype are really necessary to answer the questions that we are interested in answering uh you're right yeah um I mean one thing is clear you always need the target variable so you need to make sure what variable for example uh The Story Goes a little bit fur we had this Lane changing assistant but Lane changing is something you know not so easy to grasp because you have uh a time uh domain there because it's not you know L Lane is change but you have different phases and we think about we resort our thing and we made a emergency break assistant so we make a assistance with the environmental factors and say what is the reason that he breaks in time so there is no Collision or there is a collision so Target variable was does a collision happen and if yes how strong was it so how many ctim or meters was the breaking distance Too Short that an impact happened so you you are very sure I think one or two or three Target variables but with the environmental V variables you're completely right you can add some things for example we figured out the temperature is one of the main drivers of our model while the visual things the visual sensoric they seldom have an impact on on the target variables so they are almost neglectable so you can think about if it's almost neglectable so the caual strength from this PA is very low maybe let's make an easier life and neglect this for the first iteration and and think maybe our answers also uh our question is also answerable with uh with a subgraph yeah mhm so we're coming back in a sense again to this place of making an optimal decision give or finding a tradeoff between accuracy or precision and making something practically exactly that's that's a dilemma in the end you need to be like uh you know somebody is balancing on a on a rope uh I would always encourage to be more on the Practical side because you can so easily get lost if you want to have high standards of accuracy beforehand uh cuz if you need it first make a short try and like I said before maybe you're already in a dead end and all the accuracy you would have added at the first place is uh wasted time and effort so I I think you can be if you're perfect gistic tendency uh you can get lost easily but Cal models stay are a playing Ground you know you can make experiments and things with very low effort and when you have the courage to neglect uh things uh you can get easily questions which direct you like you know we don't plan the journey uh beforehand and we know the goal but we Zack uh towards the goal and with every iteration with every structure with every added mechanism we we get closer but we also don't run too much effort in dead ends many people who are starting with with causality uh intimidated by the fact that a dag or the graphical model that they might propose or they might come up with might not be correct and I heard this from many people and it seems that for many of them this is a blocker to start with causality and start applying it what would be your advice to those people it's a very I heard it too but I want to completely encourage you to drop this fear CU a deck is something written down about your assumptions so assumptions are there anyway so you won't do anything with data and with signs and with ask making decisions without assumptions you have them implic we know all the stomach our stomach our gut feeling we don't make decisions without assumptions and they are always there but implicitly and a de is the perfect tool to to make this assumption explicit and once you made it explicit only maybe some say a s is not so strong than a pronounced word right when you once get it to the light you already it's change a little bit how you think about it and you you don't need to keep all your assumptions in your mind and you know have a memory over blast but you write it down you can sleep at night and revisit your assumptions the assumptions are there anyway but we make it explicit with a deck so you can only win you you won't lose anything and if one wrong assumption deleted by your deck you already have made such a huge Way Forward you you wouldn't have when when you wouldn't use the deck so it's the perfect tool Cole Bandits this advice is on fire beautiful Daniel you already have a working uh prototype of your of your solution uh that can be applied in automotive and in other Industries as well wherever decision making is is at Stakes I imagine that your path was not an easy one what were the dead ends that you met on your road a paths that you thought will lead you somewhere but then you felt it's it doesn't lead us anywhere oh we had plenty of dead ends uh spontaneously one comes to my mind we were starting like so many with uh bation models you know this was at the time we started a framework which was comprehensible which was inferable where you had some Theory and you could make your calculations but we always had the feeling that uh patient models you always have the Restriction somehow to be uh more prone to be discret you can't be always continuous otherwise you have very special cases for your uh mechanisms and we wanted to we always had the feeling we want to be more um General we we don't you know want to make a tool or a set of many tools and for each problem you have another tool we want as far as possible to incorporate it so we started to think okay that there exists scms which have certain assumptions even strong assumptions like uh the independence of of the backgrounds variables uh but this is a framework which allows you discrete continuous mix of discrete and continuous and every mechanism you could think about to set this as our gold standard was you know our first uh Milestone on our project but you ask for dead ends and one of the dead end was we want to you know Gap the bridge bridge the gap or make the connection between basent models which have always this uh conditional probability tables in the discrete case and we want to reparameterize you're probably some of you who are deeper in this topic not this reparameterization trick and we try to translate you know the world of bent models into the SCM world and this was an idea to you know reuse or basically just you know to have some stability to to connect this issues and we use we implemented the reparameterization trick to um you know translate this conditional probability tables into me into a mix of um of fixed caal mechanisms and uncertainty but this was a dead end cuz you brought two words together which don't match in the end and we sticked with the general SCM cage from from then on what were your biggest discoveries on the way I would take out two discoveries um the first discovery is that basically Abduction the abduction step uh it's close to the heart of everything you want to do with uh more or less completely defined SCM so when you want to basically have an observation and you want to up propagate this observations when you want to calculate the posterior of your distributions of your background variables then you need abduction and you need this so often to incorporate into your model uh certain observations and how the distributions of the background variable shift accordingly and abduction so you need to understand that abduction is very much at the heart so so you need this and uh of course you can we calculated on pen and paper so many examples uh with small examples you can do it with pen and paper as soon as it gets more complex hence more notes more complex mechanism relationships not linear but nonlinear things and and so on and then it's not easy abduction it's not so these updates don't come natural and first we were confident and looked at some methods but they always had very big shortcomings we looked at sampling methods mcmc sampling uh we looked at other sampling methods and we looked at numerical uh methods we looked at closed form integral methods and all things have depar but many failed so we in the end we looked at nine different methods for more than one and a half year and you know it was always so feeling now we have it it works but then there was a disappointment at at some moment and it it was a hard journey and now I I don't you know want to uh get bad luck from saying but now I think we have found a method which fulfills the requirement that it's time efficient you you don't want to wait hours and days to have the abduction step but it needs to be efficient on the other hand it needs to be as precise as possible I and of course it should work for uh many uh different mechanisms and it should work for many kind of distributions and what we don't have uh you want to have different kind of noise uh mechanism how the noise is incorporated so of course you have the additive noise but if you want to make a SCM you have a general noise so you have also a multiplicated noise which is heteroscedastic scheme or even more crazy functional relationship and the higher the requirements on how do you want to incorporate it the more difficult the question is how to make the abduction step in the end and it's still uh something you you need to research you need to get better if anybody has the solution of course I I'm open-handed but we we really explored the field uh for a long time and very intensely I think this is this is a very interesting uh point and I think many people in industry are also facing similar challenges so your solution if at some point you decide to make it a public or share share with a broader audience broader Community I'm really sure that this will be very very highly appreciated to perform abduction step we also need data and your case in autonomous driving is one of the most complex ones probably that we can we can think of how do you deal with this challenge with looking for data collecting the data it's not easy you need data for the abduction step I would say that is the best case uh cuz usually you have some data points from maybe accidents happened or some records or maybe some synthetic data where you want to want to show something uh but where you need a lot of data is to find the mechanisms and there we look at public available data sets huge data sets we can incorporate even experts can give you a guidance maybe this is a quadratic relationship between these two variables then you already have the form which you need to fit and only need to fit the parameters of this form so you maybe uh have a better uh informed choice so it's not easy to have all data to fit all the mechanisms uh observations you have and we try to compensate this with um ask talking with those who make the test runs going on the test field uh having uh you know this data black boxes let's call it in the car to to get some dumps there of course they need to be coherent enough to incorporate it in Cal mechanism where it's not simply that you get the hard drive from this car and and you have you're done but it needs to be plausible data you they need to be plausible and and connected caution uh appropriate and uh on the other hand we have uh simulation simulation can also be a great uh data uh gatherer uh because you can model something specific and uh use the data from the simulation to learn the mechanism of course you can argue in some way uh the snake is biting its own tail but I think simulation data and synthetic data can also be helpful to to fill this Gia I want to take a step back and go back to what we discussed in the beginning of our ation we said that existing autonomous driving framework of Frameworks come with a set of challenges or limitations and one thing about about which uh people talk in the industry is so-called long Tales long tales in complex distributions that might bring some unexpected events what are your thoughts about this yeah great topic uh long tals are something when you experience it it's something you your alarm Bells immediately r ring cuz it's something you look you should look at when when you're doing safeguarding autonomous systems when you're doing testing cuz time after time they will produce things where you stumble and it's something basically where uh the people who are responsible uh can't sleep calm if something you know every time happens and and still happens again I first came to this when I was uh looking at the work of talb a professor at New York State un Unity I think about black Swain and there he he discusses what longtails are and I think we can very very smoothly connected with the structural caal model framework because we can reverse the question we can think longtails are a problem longtails you should have a look at and we can say what structures What mechanisms what distributions constitute or plug to together will produce in your target variable like the impact of um car accident will produce a long tail in your target variable so you can basically uh guide your search much more efficiently you can pre-filter it and you can I always Lo love to ask experts when it comes to Cal models because they can give you so much structural information mechanisms uh coincidences and thing which is all great implicit knowledge which you can incorporate into your Cal model and when you guide the experts and say if this and that mechanism played together if this distribution cames he will think Ah that's the natural distribution of this thing and when this comes together with that mechanism then we will have a longtail uh distribution in this target variable then we have a much more efficient process a much more efficient thing to to came towards this yeah uh this difficult to handle longtail things in in practice yeah it sounds like a great idea to reduce or compress your your search space so if I understand you correctly you're saying the following you look at the distribution and say hey there's a long tail in this particular place or this particular variable or or this interaction and then you go back to the model and you look for the settings of the model distributions or mechanisms the can produce a a distribution like this a long distribution and then you triangulate your findings with with the experts to narrow down the search space further is that correct exactly that's that's what uh it's just you know an idea we need to look at what implications this has and how we we can do this but this would I mean in terms of parameter search in corner cases Corner Cas is a coincidence of two two or more uh incidents like rain fog temperature conditions which individually are no extreme which won't take off the car but if they work together if they you know incorporate together like minus 1° no problem when it's dry no much problem for the wheels slight rain also no problem but when minus one degree temperature and slight rain comes together then you will have sudden eyes on the street and it's a basically one easy example for a coincidence where where you have a corner case and this corner cases if you want to find them you always have this huge multi-dimensional parameter and if you can narrow it down if you can make the search field smaller you are very lucky because you you have achieved something which is very difficult I want to ask you one more question related to to what you said before so when we talk about those Corner cases and we talk about about other difficult scenarios that we might encounter then we ask oursel ourselves questions like which I which basic questions I should ask to make sure that we can deal with those with those challenges will often go back to the idea this very basic idea in causality called identifiability In Your solution how important this idea of identifiability is and how did you tackle the challenges related to the fact that sometimes maybe we we need to accept the fact that the system will have unobservable unobservable variables I wouldn't even say uh it's the unlikely case so I think it's the likely case that you have unobserved variables that you have hidden confounding that you have everything which you have not a completely defined caal models with all mechanisms parameters where you can't collect data easily so I think this is in most cases I mean depends when you have a mechanical system where you know everything then then you are fine but this is I think the more General case and you still can work with it CU you mentioned it the identifiability what what is it it tells you you have a specific question you have one two three specific questions we can tell you can you answer this question from this caal structure so you at first place you need no data no mechanism fitted you just need to think about the structure and we can tell you and you need to think about your questions you want to answer in this domain you want to answer in this domain and then we can tell you is this question can we answer it from from here and we tell you also for which which variables you need to collect data and you can decide okay uh I take the effort and I am capable of collecting data uh for this variable then we can give a very good answer to this question or you say oh that's a huge data it's not practical or too much cost and whatever to to collect data for this maybe let's answer a easier question but if the answer to this easier question is already no we don't need to take the effort to answer the more difficult question so we maybe are capable to replace your more sophisticated a difficult question by one or two easier question and if already one is the answer no you don't need the effort to already make the Second Step so this is a very good guidance in the in the Chunnel of uh decision making and uh it's a great thing you know to know what is ready to be made and what's the price behind the answer cuz when you don't know I mean when you start from the blank and don't know what's the price you for one question the price is one months one Engineers that down okay this and for another it's maybe 2 years and I don't want to spend the money and the resources and effort maybe in another so the price for answers the price for good decisions we can we can give them a price tick that's an excellent point and I'd love everyone to hear that uh many people who are just starting with causality they have this fear about drawing a wrong dag but the second fundamental fear is that they will have in their system some unobserved variables that they cannot record and and add to the system the point of view that you just presented and from the point of view of more advanced identification algorithms we know that this is not always and not necessarily A a roadblock Daniel what will be your advice for people who are just starting with something maybe machine learning or causal inference or they want to start working in industry and they feel a little bit unsure if they will be a able to learn everything that is needed to be successful in those fields all right you asked me for a characteristics my first thought was uh I'm honestly not because I'm standing in front of you but your book is a great uh introduction so we have a working student in artificial intelligence she makes her Bachelor at the moment and he learned from your book and she gave the feedback uh on presenting some part uh that it's great introduction so if you want to learn the theory then or the theory and the practical application and have a great overview your book is uh I think one of the first addresses to look at uh when it comes to characteristic um I think resilience is a an important thing because yeah Cal inference isn't uh exercise which is practiced with ease I mean sometimes when you have done all your homework your preparation then you might be striving but it's nothing which comes so easy to you so you should be resilient you should have a frustration tolerance uh to to keep uh being sneaky to be confident that finally you will have something better you had before so that I think a very important characteristics of course they apply also to to other fields but here I would highlight them because it's not you know a charted field so you need to experiment you need to play around so experimental mindset I would mention uh maybe also playfulness so okay uh let's start with the first little deck let's see what it can bring us and let's iterate and from the starting point let's be curious let's be playful let's be experimental who would you like to thank oh I I own I really own than uh lot of people uh before of all I want to thank my team so I hope I don't forget anybody now it's uh Clara it's Toby it's clao it's Katarina it's Sergey uh Thomas and it's Andreas so I owe them basically all the paper they read all the ideas all the effort they put uh in the crazy ideas I had to make them reality so they are a great team and I owe them a lot I want to thank them honestly for their effort the last the last years when you go with the Prototype of your solution to the market and you speak with your potential customers what are the biggest challenges that you encounter in conveying the value of the solution yeah it's not easy to talk to customers cuz you need to find the right language we are still probing to find the right thing uh our last try was to basically answer or ask three questions related to each stage of the Cal letter for their domain uh to make them you know see what what kind of questions they can they they can get answers to when I talk to people who have certain problems where they already match to our solution is one common seam was transportability for example they have machines in different environments and they have a downtime you know nobody wants that their machine has downtime and it's the same machine or almost the same machine and here it comes it's different climate conditions maybe this machines operating different time into function so on some uh parameters you they are identically or almost identically but to others they are diverse and this is a transportability scheme where you want to see if you can change your model towards what's same and what's different uh to to answer question so so this was heard from some manufacturing uh related companies that they have a problem in this domain so just to give those in our audience who are less familiar with the idea of trans transportability a little bit of an intuition transportability is when we want to take conclusions from one context and apply them to another context which is in itself a causal problem vanilla example is you have a shop in Los Angeles selling a surf boards uh how would the surfboard selling be in New York so some parameters are the same you have the same surfboards but you have different C clients they have different beach access and so on so some things are similar and others are diverse and you want to compare this things and more often than not to stress it you compare if you take non-al approach apples with uh pce and that's problematic and we basically want to recog recogniz that's a p and the Apple but we want to still press out what what still can be done in in this in this circumstances do you feel that there is a need for more people with causal expertise in industry in general definitely I would say and not only I'm working in this field CU basically when you don't use causality you are at a certain point in a dead end uh you will make wrong decisions you will have implicit assumptions uh you don't understand your data and you don't make your decisions righteous I mean time after time this this will be important and just I mean the the first step is to accept that many models are just associative so uh you basically just copycat everything which is there that works for many domains very good but at some points you will make decisions which are simply wrong uh I have a famous example which is uh in mind which is cited by Paul hamund in his online course on udemy that Google basically wanted to analyze how is the gender pay Gap and they ended up in I can read the story maybe in the internet uh long story short they rise the wage of men's because they made a so-called Simpson Paradox reverse and so you take decisions and even huge Industries like Google where you think they should be very Pro and very you know skilled with handling data even they take wrong decisions because this connections between cality storytelling data scientists and from this Incorporated in making good decisions this is something yeah which is important so every data scientist everybody related with decisions everybody related with complex systems will take huge profit now and even in the next years from caal mindset from caal methods what what resources books or other resources had the biggest impact on your CLE Jour Journey it's quite um common I would say there I need to think if there is something extraordinary but okay let me side the most common thing has started with the book of why with the standard work cality from Pearl uh with the primer to you know uh have a little bit of shortcut from from everything uh I read the book from shulov and jansing uh uh Cal elements of Cal inference um especially two chapters with Interventional and counterfactual queries they have already good python examples uh then of course the many toolboxes so PGM are already mentioned uh there are other great tool boxes I can't side them now but uh there are because they Gap the bridge between it's a theoretical model and you actually can process something and that's as a practical guide has a huge impact on me so course cority is something where you can have the complete Spectrum you can be a philosopher and just use your mind and you can be the handsome practical guy who has a you know a pot of data and want to processor then all the spectrum is influenced and will be influenced by by cality where can people learn more about your and your team's work so we published a few papers so that's a let's say academic access to us uh we are always happy you know to discuss uh with you personally uh so you just can email me or yeah reach out for me probably we can link my email address or my team members and we made uh you know already uh LinkedIn excursions to you know contact people from different Industries to Simply discuss their problems uh with us and see if yeah if disc ction methods is you know a perfect match cuz because at this state where we are we have a prototype we have we have really great algorithms that start uh but we need a pilot P project where we can you know one thing is the examples where you what you do in a development project in the other is to get real benefit in industrial setting and to get nearer to this we need an early adopter minded customer who wants to discuss his problem with us and we say not easily but if it's match this is a match and we can can go through this so you can contact me on LinkedIn via email we can have a short conversation I'm I'm very open uh to discuss this field which I'm very close to Daniel is there any question that you would like to ask me oh that's a unexpected one uh I would need to think a moment of course there are many questions uh we know each other now a bit we had a branch together uh but what was I know that you was into machine learning also through the Andre and G course and I was curious what was your you know transition from machine learning to cality what what brought you there maybe all the P all the audience know already but I'm curious honestly that's a that's a great question um my first encounter with kaliti was in 2017 uh we we had a neuroscientific hackathon and we're trying to trans the ideas of so-called functional connectivity so how in act activities in different parts of brain might produce certain emergent qualities uh we're wondering if if this ideas can be applied to other complex systems like economy or social groups interactions and so on and at some point U I realized working with different methods for analyzing associations like information theoretic um measures and correlation and all this stuff we're hitting a we're hitting a wall constantly because we didn't know hey actually what does this mean that these things are related using this method and another method maybe they are not related actually so I was the first time when I started thinking about about the importance of of causal thinking and then a couple of years later I read the book of why and that was the moment where I really felt I want to dive deeper into this I was struck by the clarity of Pearl's framework and Clarity of his of his thinking in the book yeah so that was my that was my journey and then I was so curious how to implement how to put this in practice that was around the time when Amit Sharma from Microsoft started developing DUI so that was the first package that I that I started diving deeper into what's your message for for the caal community Community or coal python Community oh stay curious stay experimental uh look out what what development brings us try this uh caual mindset uh I think if you it's like a a a good virus not not a bad virus a good virus uh once you you you are infected by this virus it will be maybe a lifetime journey to you know be curious to to have this high standards of making sense of things answering diff difficult questions and making things more understandable proper proper and yeah better I think so yeah that's my message great thank you so much it was a pleasure Daniel I hope you will have a wonderful rest of your day thank you Alex congrats on reaching the end of this episode of the caal bandits podcast stay tuned for the next one if you like this episode click the like
