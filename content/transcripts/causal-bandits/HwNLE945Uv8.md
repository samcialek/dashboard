when someone asked me how I like this conference I remember I told them that the only thing I can compare it to is how I failed in 2014 2015 at Deep learning and machine learning related events incredible energy and incredible willingness to share and to learn from each other in an incredible amount of inspiration this is Cole Bandits extra from the Cole AI conference 2024 in London at the Royal Society I hope you will enjoy this one perhaps one of the biggest nuggets in causality that I had was of recent is that jeans can potentially be used as instrumental variables since they're not likely to have confounders I thought that really insightful what is one quaal question that you don't know an answer to but you would like it's less on the technical side it's more on human cognitive side it's how to start causal approach with in a company how to bring all that useful knowledge to be effective within a setting of addressing questions about product and what's the main challenge for you today so I came in today kind of skeptical about how useful it is intellectually I find it very interesting and have been hooked for the past few years but I've been really inspired by a lot of inputs from people who have experience about the creativity involved how to address the fact that whereas a it is interesting it is a cognitive effort for stakeholders and how to address those sort of challenges got I'm really pumped out from conversations with people about addressing these issues implementing these ideas within company study hi everybody I Maas lers I just spoke at the coal AI conference here in the Royal Society and uh to be honest I had a blast here it's uh been great and thank you Alex for inviting me and thank you to the coal lens organization team it was actually a very very intriguing a very very interesting uh session today what is your main Insight from the conference so far I think it really boils down to what Gideon from the M group uh spoke at the very end it is communication is key and when we're talking about communication is when how we actually understand everything from the problem set onset and setting to how we model things all the way to how we actually transmit this knowledge to stakeholders and at all these points you actually need to communicate with the various stakeholders with the team the experts etc etc and really going on the same level with everybody either technical or non-technical background is very very important in order to achieve success r at the end of the day what is one causal question that you don't know an answer to but you would like to that's an interesting one I think from a purely theoretical kind of perspective and like actual active research I would go with what happens when the causal graph changes over time time because nothing is stationary nothing is static question that has been bothering me for quite a while now and I think we will see some very very interesting pieces of work coming out later on this exact topic what's your main challenge in your research work today if you can share it I think the understanding of a specific problem and the factors at play is always a challenge because every new problem comes with different factors different kind of settings but I think I'll go back to the actual communication being able to to transmit the insights and also ask the proper questions that are going to be unlocking the problem is the most difficult part of all and there's no prescribed way of doing it because each case is really different and at the end of the day really it is uh what again as I said before like what makes fence a failed project to a successful project and when you try I and invest in this communication and understanding between people it really sets the the background and the base for Success hi my name is mimu I am a senior research data scientist I've done humi my background is in computer science and my PhD was on causal methods for measuring online influence uh when people interact online what's your main Insight from the conference so far uh my main Insight is um that it's going to be a bit of a meta Insight so there were a lots of interesting talks I it's really great to see Co methods appreciated and explored across industry from many different sectors lots of excitement and different kinds of causal inquiry as well interventions counterfactuals it's really good to see all this activity from so many different angles what is one causal question that you don't know an answer to what you would like to again it's a bit of a meta answer I guess one causal question in terms of when you design a causal analysis I think one question that the analyst has to come up with a good answer to Is when you draw your proposal diagram where do you stop what's the sort of boundary the scope of relevance which factors should be in the diagram where does it go too far into detail and you don't need for that level of detail what is the main challenge in your work today that you are facing in your work today if you can share yes yes let's see one challenge is first of all caal methods are really valuable but it can be challenging as we saw in the conference to get everyone on board to understand caal methods properly that's kind of why I think a key thing to grasp is the distinction between identification and estimation so that's a really key thing there's so many great resources online but people sometimes see a method and they just go and apply it you need to be really careful when you read uh about new methods is this estimation is it identification does it assume randomized treatment assignment or not so from the methods perspective I think that's a challenge but there's lots of good resources out there to guide people around that and in practice I think yeah there's so many causal problems so um it's really important to try and get business stakeholders to really grasp the value of answering them properly in a causal way so that's something that is really of value and you need a good careful approach with using analogies and so on like we saw today to get people to really grasp the value and reap the benefits of caal methods hello everyone my name is Fernanda hin I'm a data scientist at crowd we're a full digital agency based in London but we also have offices um all in the UK and New York in Dubai about my background I studied two my bachelor degrees when applied mathema and one in economics back in Mexico I have a master in optimization and data analytics by the University of physics I've worked with Data consultancy before and now well I'm a crowd discovering new ways of implementing fality in the marketing uh yeah world what's the main Insight from the conference so far I think it's very interesting to see how each company tackles the same problem in a different way it was interesting to see not only the technical part but also the business part of how we ask this questions it's very simple to say what if something had happened in a different way that it actually happened but contextualizing this makes it way more approachable and it also gives you new ideas of how to solve your problems as well so I think getting this pool of ideas was the best of the conference definitely what's one Cal question that you don't know an answer to but you would like to one of the questions that I have and I do not have an answer but I have a belief is that's allowed is that there is a limited amount of yeah contrafactual that you can ask yourself in order to get actual yeah informative information for your problem my belief is that there are a limited number of what if questions for a specific scenario until the point where the Yeah the more what if that you get won't really bring you much information to change your outcome if that makes sense but I do not know how to answer that yet may you give me a couple of Years hopefully I can find a way what's the main challenge that you are facing today in your work if you can share it yeah of course I'm new in the marketing World well kind of you I've been working in this Agency for 11 months and I think the biggest challenge is to keep up with yeah the constant change that is happening in our industry so data science is a big topic right now everybody is talking about Ai and about implementing models but they're not really they don't go into the detail of how much time it gets you to learn a new one really understand the assumptions and then be able to mix and analyze one yeah in in comparison to another or even together so I think the main challenge for me has been putting AI in a way well yeah putting AI in a way that it complements without yeah without really substituting and making that also clear for our clients without getting too technical but technical enough so that people can trust it as much trans we great hi my name is Clara and my I have a background in computer science and a PD in artificial intelligence and I'm a lead data scientist at bbba AI Factory which is a bbba is a bank second largest bank in Spain what is your main Insight from the conference so far for me like all talks were great but the underlying question of why things happened and how the different people answered the why in their different sectors like well Spotify or music sector or a trips traveling or even VP was great yeah what is Oneal question that you don't know an answer to but you would like it so like working in banking I'm always worried about how can we help customers cope with dep when they face difficulties so one question is how can we understand those factors to H design solutions for for customers and also for the bank so what the main challenge that you're facing at your work today so I think that data scientist or I personally like going to conferences and know what people are doing outside so when we come back and bring it inside sometimes it's difficult to test it inside so I think H one of our Challenge and also our work is to bring that uh Vision that is happening outside inside but we're making it I'm kavier I work at bbba as an expert at a science I have a degree in economics and I'm currently studying maths and I love data science what's your main Insight from the conference here okay so the main Insight is that I've looked at how many comp companies approach uh cality and I've got some ideas to bring into our companies about some things that I didn't know like uh contactor reasoning what is one C of question that you not don't know how answer to but you would like it okay how do you approach a problem where you have a cal effect estimation and the positivity assumption is broken and you don't have the main knowledge on the ground I say that because in banking this happens a lot but you have the main knowledge of the in the ground so you can do some magic so that's my question what is the main challenge that you're facing from the world today okay try to convince uh business people about the importance of advanced analytics amazing I'm Al R I'm a data scientist at B and I'm a computer scientist what's the main Insight from the conference conference was full of insights and I learned so much so many different topics such as costal Discovery costal reference methods being applied at different Industries which are be interesting and I'll certainly have to uh read them in detail put one couple question that you don't know in asset to but you would like to I like to get more information about ensuring our C graphs are actually true what's the main challenge that you face today at your work the qk shirt I'd say maybe getting sure that my estimated Tre effects are actually right I'm Hugo I'm working as a machine learning scientist at booking.com and my background is that I did a PhD in computer science in interpretable machine learning I have worked before at Huawei and at CI in Finland that's about me for now what's the main Insight from the conference so far I'll say the main insight first is to see such amazing and enthusiastic people in causal influence I would say that sorry to spoil but your talk in uh in assumptions is actually quite enlighting because people spend too much time talking about assumptions and not about how can I actually deliver something that is useful despite the assumptions and I think that stuck with me because it's something I thought about sometimes but didn't formulate appreciate it thank you what's one causal question that you don't know an answer to but you would like to I mean the biggest causal question question for me at the moment is if llms are going to stuck by for a long time or they're just a passing moment what's the main challenge that you face at your worth today if you can it I think the main challenge that I'm trying to deal with is with cannibalization and interference and trying to think about these problems in the landscape of Ecommerce and how to take into account that in terms of modeling and uh yeah my name is debor and I am the founder of SEI so basically I founded this company to add advise small to midsize businesses on their AI strategies and Ai workflows and data science my background is actually academic I was doing academic research until last year I come from the Imaging field so that's how I got into machine learning and then I decided to explore the Brave New World and turn to the business kind of environment what's the main insight for you from this conference so far Main Ides is perhaps that cowo AI is doing a great job thinks that the critical limitations of classical machine learning models such as to give like directional flows or like importance for features and to contributes a lot to explainable AI which is something that for example if you think about a neuron Network there isn't not even that's actually makes a whole new difference because well people bring up that they have a much easier life talking to shareholders because St various like stakeholders because they can actually explain why they want to take certain directions or to go for certain options and that's great also to understand the actual cause of something so that it's like to do the the thing that basically every data scientist dreams of to differentiate from correlation yeah what's one Cal question that you don't know an answer to but you like it I'm not sure actually that's great that's okay thank you so much hi uh my name is pit I'm the head of data science at crowd I be the head of data science ATR for a year now closey the key things that I'm trying to CH solve for Our Brands is how effective the marketing is right where do you want to spend the Strategic the Tactical decision making that comes with it so that's basically my role right now what's your main Insight from the conference so far oh the key Insight is overall one of the key challenges that we face with marketing is the ability to balance your interpretability with accuracy historically we've had a challenge with mmm in an effort to you know kind of balance interpretability and accuracy they always feel 95% of the mmm never ever get used so there's so many questions that get unsolved what if I had not done Marketing in the first place right the question of incrementality or what if I spent a bit more on Channel y or on channel Zed right these are really really hard questions to answer in marketing and I really really wanted to solve that I been talking to people around here in the conference I see that's such an exponentially bigger problem than I actually really imagined it to be and yeah I mean that's that's my biggest take with how do we actually end up solving it I understand you know Co is quite new the ad option is not yet there but for me it's like how do we solve that particular problem and that's the reason I'm here today what's one caal question that you don't know an answer to but you would like costal questions from a company point of view right it's the long-term effectiveness of brand so I spend money today how does it impact one year down the line how does it impact two years down the line should I actually quit spending money on brand marketing it's such a hard question to answer because the immediate kpis are never visible you run an experiment and you would figure out oh yeah there's no impact is that really how brand works that's such a hard question to come down to isn't it right that for me is the biggest what's the cost impact of me spending money on brand marketing on videos on TV ads how does it really work how does it enable my Performance Marketing right does it impove my Crick through rates I still do not really have an answer that's why quation comes into play right that's our biggest challenge the last question I want to ask you is about the biggest challenge you face in your work today I work with a lot of CMOS and CFOs right the question that a CFO a CMO wants to answer is what if I spent a bit more money on my marketing whereas a CFO wants to curtail the budgets wants to say right you shouldn't be spending so much for me it's resolving that particular conflict right and I absolutely love it showing what would happen if you have not spent money on marketing versus what would happen if you spend a bit more or if even a bit less right it's all about making that marketing Effectiveness solving that particular marketing Effectiveness question for me this will make a question than that hi I'm ponit Gupta I'm from Cisco system on a leader forecasting data science team that uses coal AI to predict Cisco's demand what is your M Insight from the conference today so far we are on a journey here and we are a journey to discover truth and it's not going to come through traditional machine learning uh because uh there are just too many confusions that are involved with it we really need a way to disentangle and to actually find relationships and directions and things like that which is something that causal inference helps us to do what is one caal question that you don't know an answer to but you would like to one just one okay I guess it would be really nice to understand if we built a causal graph on a response or a target of Interest what the uncertainty was in its prediction in its completeness because obviously we don't know the ground truth right wish we did we don't and so we're in the process of discovering it how could we understand you know how close we are to the truth and then what the effect of that is in the uncertainty of the predictions what is the main that you base in your work today something you can share I think some of it is related to what I just said around ranges it's a very Target Rich environment uh and so there's a lot to do and I think from a resource perspective that's probably the hardest thing is to have the type of resources and the ability to answer all the pressing questions that are there because I think uh what is there what causal inference and caal AI of offer is really breakthrough stuff but we need to get to it and it's we are limited right now by the tools that we have and the people that we have I think it's a broad problem statement but and there are many things underneath that you know problem statement out there you know and you named the question trying to answer it well trying to answer it fast trying to answer it in a way in which you can connect and actually change the workplace I'm Arthur mow I a senior data scientist working for Sephora and Retail problems in general what's what's the main challenge that you face at your work today something you can sh so the main challenge is mostly like matching the caal AI insights with the business uh intuition and trying to match those two and integrate business insight into coal Ai and also present coal results to to business yeah
