science is I I think I mentioned that before is not a linear thing it is very much all over the place and it is the essence of exploration that kind of drives us this notion of causality that we for example are doing here in Spotify and I've been doing in my in the later parts of my PhD back in Imperial is not only on the modeling part and I think it's wrong to think that any causality comes only in the modeling part if you could distribute like $1 billion for for causal research what would you invest in causality does not emerge in a flat Idan space so if you want a latent space that has emerging causality in it hey causal Bandits welcome to the causal Bandits podcast the best podcast on causality and machine learning on the internet this week we're going back to London to meet our guest he loves puzzles and believes that causal Discovery is a better one than causal inference we work for apple and with NASA stakeholders at seti Institute but Founders home at Spotify he's a fan of Star Trek a former radio host and a computer scientist specialized in medical imaging research scientist at Advanced causal inference Lab at Spotify ladies and Gentlemen please welcome Dr athanasios Bonos let me pass it to your host Alex thank you for having me welcome to the show thank you it's a very nice and cold day here in London and I'm very happy that you're here and we have we get to have this nice discussion I'm also very happy thank you for joining us I want to start our conversation with a with a quote I think if you're a radiologist you are like the coyote in the cartoon you're already over the edge of the cliff but you haven't yet look down there's no ground underneath people should stop training Radiologists now it's completely obvious that in 5 years deep learning is going to do better than Radiologists Jeffrey Hinton November 24th 2016 what's your comment on this that's a very nice one and to be honest I had completely forgotten that Hinton had even said that back then I personally a lot of other people in the community of the medical iming and definitely a lot of Radiologists would respectfully disagree and it's kind of tough going against one of the Godfathers of like deep learning right I think that well we are 8 years past that point and like almost a decade and we still haven't had like radiologist being replaced by AI for multiple reasons really one of the points is that a radiologist job is not only on identifying lesions or making like metrics of for example the circumference of a baby's head in ultrasound it comes a lot with the decision making the evaluating of the of the things that they see in the image and something that systems like deep Learning Systems cannot yet learn that well it is associations between different things different things that in first level or in first pass look completely relevant but at the end of the day they are and this is where the human brain with the experience like that they have amassed by being radiologist by going through 10 or more years of like medical school training excels that and this is something very very difficult to replace with a ml system and this is kind of like so this is one very key point and the other one is really the decision making like you making life and death decisions for patients with being a radiologist or any sort of doctor for that matter and these kind of decision- making things still ml like a systemis are not there yet to be able to make in a robust and way that we can trust them completely maybe with more causal uh learning and more causal kind of inference and Discovery you you can get there but like not now and then moreover like moving away a bit from the purely Technical and theoretical points of the building the ml system it is the legal and the ethical point of view because again we are making life and death decisions like we are affecting a person's life by making a medical like diagnosis with them and like if we make a wrong diagnosis who's to blame is it the model that is a few lines of code is it the company that built it or is it the doctor that kind of okay did it so like these kind of legal considerations need to be like built in and we still as a society haven't progressed to the to the point that we can we can like replace radiologist with AI systems we definitely and I think this is the key point that the entire community of the medical iming field is trying to do is like give better tools give better tools build better tools that can enable radiologist to do their job much better and much more efficient but not replace them because this human expertise this deep knowledge that they have is irreplaceable even to build more more models and better models we still need them maybe in the future we won't need as many Radiologists but we're definitely going to be needing some radiologist what do you see as the main technical challenges is in the context of of this quote and and in the context of what you just uh of what you just said what would we need to overcome in order to make the vision that that Hinton is presenting here true this is a difficult one mostly because the further deep and in you probe the more challenges you'll come up with more a lot of them interconnected and a lot of them very very crucial to the success of such a vision it really starts off with your data really I think Hinton will completely agree that data having good data and good quality data is key in order to build any sort of ml algorithm but like what actually constitutes good data and for example in a medical field you need to have a very representative like data set if you for example over the in the very start of the pandemic let me like do a little detour and um anecdotal evidence here in the very start of the pandemic there was a series of papers and a series of data sets that came up trying to build ml tools AI tools that can like uh detect covid however if you actually probed a bit deeper into them you would see that all the positives were coming from x-rays from China where all the negatives were x-rays from Stanford to the US that essentially you build a very biased and very not that great kind of data set because you're basically building a classifier whether or not the patient had an x-ray in China or in the US rather than if they had like Co or not so this kind of thing is one like and if we go deeper into a more like because x-rays are fairly easy medical modality if you go deeper into ultrasounds or like MRIs pets uh PET CT and pet that is etc etc you will see that you have variations even within uh the same machine but like with different in different hospitals so like if you have a Zan's machine in here in London and a Zan's machine up in Endra based on how the doctors use it you might have a different quality of image and hence you can have this unobserved kind of like confounding elements here because that affect the output image and hence your diagnosis so in reality thinking about this in actually a causal way might help you build a better data set you don't this notion of cality that we for example are doing here in Spotify and I've been doing in my in the later parts of my PhD back when like back in Imperial is not only on the modeling part and I think it's wrong to think that any causality comes only in the modeling part it comes in the entire system building process from the data collection thinking about which parameters come into play obviously the data modeling and then to actually making it robust and serving it to the End customer so this is for example a very like crucial Point Gathering correct data especially in the medical field is extremely hard and extreme crucial in the success of this kind of vision then comes the actual modeling thing like again we have uh that pretty much is as any other modeling operation needs to abide by certain Like rules in order to make some like good and robust models and finally it is how you actually Implement them these things like um how you implement them in production are they going to be replacing like totally radiologist like Hinton suggested or are they going to be Tools in my opinion they should be tools you never should uh replace the these people but you can give them correct tools to make them lives easier and hence see more patients and diagnose patience more correctly and more fast but yeah I think these are like some on a very high level these are some very crucial challenges and it all comes down to the way of thinking and approaching the problem I think it's a very nice quote uh very good friend of mine who right now is in Berlin said back when I was in high school like you only solve a problem when you realize where is a problem and this is essentially it like you need to realize where is a problem identify the key elements of the problem and then you can solve it it's not only the modeling it's not only the data it's a lot of other both said and unsa kind of components that we introduced in there I really love this quote and I to go back to this quote in a second but before I want to ask you another question in one of your papers you look at models or systems automated systems for for medical imaging analysis and perhaps decision making maybe just in intention through the lens of Technology Readiness levels and one of the things that you and your callers write about is that many systems today in in the context of of of of Medicine of Health are essentially jumping from one level to another passing two or three crucial levels on on the way can you share with our audits a little bit more regarding this regarding this topic and and maybe give us a little bit of a of a hint why these things are important in practice of course of course so just for like the benefit of the audience here they technology Readiness levels came about from the US military back in the ' 50s if I'm not mistaken they are still used they actually have been incorporated into ISO standards and they are used by the military they're used by NASA they're used by a lot of like people that like in the Aerospace specifically uh industry and they they are a way of formalizing and making a framework of how to develop any sort of technology and this allows them to evaluate the Readiness of this technology before you actually produce it and you they are like flight tradi as they would say in the Aerospace a few years ago some people that with with some I've actually collaborated and they like amazing amazing at their job including well Kieran that is here in uh Spotify including yarin G including other stakeholders from like NASA set Institute Intel bunch of startups they they produced a paper that discusses the technology Readiness levels as they apply to ml and machine learning algorithms and they go through all these kind of things and they kind of map in the kind of road map like they map the technology redness levels to the road map of developing an AI product uh what we said in our paper with Bernhard and Daniel my two uh PD supervisors back if I go to 2022 so the paper was written in 2021 but like it took some while some time until it was made public and what we argued there is that even in the medical imaging kind of ml from Medical Imaging field you still need these things these are kind of universal these are task and application agnostic and when a lot of people just jump through them they might not give enough consideration in each one jum around and then it becomes kind of quite of a mess really and this like introduces problems really when you try to develop such a thing so going steadily through these like technology Rance levels having checks and balances essentially make sure make sure that everything that you're doing is okay and there is accountability for what's going on because exactly in the medical field as we said before the it is life and death in the Aeronautics field it is life and death as well as we have recently learned when we move away from just simple applications like Chad zpt might help you write a better essay for sure but it's not a mission critical uh kind of application when you go into these kind of fields of Aeronautics of uh medic Etc we need to be sure and robust and essentially this is this framework helps you do that what we argued in that paper as well was that you can introduce a bit the essence of causality actually you can do that as I said before throughout the technology R like uh levels but like mostly in the point that after you have built some kind of MVP then you can make it robust it's this kind of robustification of your system in other like Fields it might have been like making it robust to like radiation when you like shoot things up in space but in this case it's just making sure that the model is not looking at SP correlations that will throw it off I want to go back now to the quote that you shared before uh so the quote says and correct me if I if I misremembered it that we can only solve a problem if we know that it's that it's it is a problem when we were talking about um Medical Imaging now and about technology Readiness levels I had this thought that in Broad machine Learning Community we often forget that those models deep learning models for instance they also they're also based on assumptions and so during the the last let's let's call it the last stage of deep learning Revolution we're moving from statistical parametric learning into non-parametric large models and it seems that uh somewhere on the way we forgot that although we are getting rid of some assumptions so a neural networks is neural network is a more flexible model in terms of assumptions and linear regression for instances there are still some assumptions underlying those models and if we want those models to be robust and to generalize we need to remember about those those those assumptions yeah absolutely like um I don't think we can get away with no assumptions it's practically impossible to do that we always going to make some assumptions but not all assumptions are created equal uh there are assumptions that are very valid like the sun is going to like like uh rise up tomorrow morning from the East that's fine we can live with that assumption U but there are other assumptions that are not really valid the assumption that model is going to work only if there are pink elephants on the moon drinking tea obviously it's not going to be it's not going to live that well the point of the Assumption is yes we are relaxing some assumptions we are the problem that I see is that sometimes we are forgetting some assumptions anything will have assumptions a common criticism of causal inference and causal Discovery is that it relies on a lot of assumptions but at least we making the assumptions very much explicit the the assumptions are there anybody can test them we try again again to relax them to challenge them and we can disagree about them as well and discuss them because we need to uh explicitly say what I'm coming what I'm putting on table I need to tell you in advance right exactly yeah know this is very very spot on and this is a great way of doing science and technology there are the assumptions that sometimes they are forgotten and these are the ones that sometimes create problems for example a very like a very standard thing that I always point out in this kind of discussions is the assumption that models are have ukian latent spaces this is not true it was a paper I think 2017 or 2018 by Lo or no Aran now uh called latent space audity very nice title I'm very jealous of that title and what they were saying they was that they were probing a very standard VA variation Auto encoder that and they were saying that okay the all the assumption that we made is like all this kind of optimization that we're doing assumes a ukan lat in space how and a very standard kind of like a distribut Go distribution that lives in a ukan space but if we actually prob it the model is not building such a thing they it's building a highly High dimensional reman manifold that is bit hard to kind of characterize but it is a rem manifold and they showed that by doing some interpolations if they followed the cat of the reming manifold they had perfect interpolations from point A to point B while if they did linear kind of ukle interpolations it was like in the in between the two points you get noise some people have to their like big credit kind of challenge this assumption they build like hyperbolic machine learning models and they have like some amazing papers I I like I very much respect all this kind of line of uh investigation and this is very nice because it was challenge this exception is challenged and I think this is the key Point here that the all the assumptions there's always going to be assumptions not all assumptions are created equal so we need to pick which assumptions we can live with and after that we need to make very explicit what these assumptions are and not forget about them because if we forget about them then the roomors is going to be like looking spotless but underneath the AR there going to be a massive stain and that can cause problems afterwards in one of the projects that you worked on here at Spotify with Jacob zler was also guest at our podcast you worked on adaptation of uh synthetic control estimator to one of your use cases here at the company and you also looked into sensitivity analysis so combined you did a couple of interesting things in this paper I think in one one one interesting thing is that you combine the estimator coming more from the potential outcomes or econometrics literature with identification strategies that are coming from pean more from the pean tradition and then you also put a sensitivity analysis model on on on top of this can you tell us a little bit more about what was your thinking in this project in the context of of what you just mentioned assumptions and how to deal with assumptions when we are faced with a particular real world problem yeah absolutely so first of all I need to like uh say that like first of all like Jacob's uh podcast episode with you actually heard last week from the time of record so it's very very nice shows continuity but and we also need to give credit to both Jacob and Kieran that did a lot of work especially Jacob who was interning with us last year here and yeah so that paper was very interesting because exactly we took synthetic control something very common in econometrics we took sensitivity analysis again fairly common in some fields we mired them together with a bit of like the peran reasoning framework work and challenge some assumptions that were made there funny enough when we published that in clear in last year pear did tweet about it and it was very nice it was my second interaction with PE and it's very nice to get recognized by a person of that caliber and um but congrats thank you but yeah essentially this is it like when we are faced with uh real life problem like the ones we're facing here in the company like the ones we face when we deal with medical imaging like the ones that we face the the setting Studio that you you mentioned we need to be pragmatic about it we need to it actually poses an interesting challenge even in my mind at least in in my psychic a bit more interesting Challenge and like than blue sky research because you have real life constraints we cannot do anything we cannot make any sort of assumptions we need to tell in real life we need to live with the real world around us and this creates a very interesting kind of test bed to to build new models essentially this is what we did like we tried to challenge a bit the the way of thinking like uh and combin hands uh synthetic controls with like the formalize them under the Paran kind of framework and uh the results to be honest are quite nice and the ctiv analysis really comes there and ties it all together because exactly of this thing we wanted to know when these assumptions and when these kind of models would sensely fail and why what would take it what kind of like circumstances would actually lead them to fail and hence create something that is very robust and very good in this context um what would you say to people who come from an angle where they criticize causal inference and they say like just to give you some like approximate quotes from some of some of my content that that I read sometimes causal inference is only in its very early years you cannot is in practice like the assumptions make it completely useless so there are quotes like this and actually I started looking at people who are producing this kind of comments and I noticed that there's a common common thread uh how so what what is a Common Thread well it's actually I don't know if I want to I don't want to stigmatize any group you know of people so I will pass on this question but but there is one so I will tell you of the record as a person who worked with with causal models and appli them in practice in context of Medical Imaging in context of a company that works with with artists with music and so on and so on what would be your answer to those people from a point of view of a person who actually does this in practice well first of all I would Point them to decades and decades long of literature and practice in both econometrics and epidemiology that they are using a lot of caal models like the a lot of things that we take from like and we apply in the computer science kind of field do do come from epidemiology do come from econometrics for example the paper that we had uh together with Kieran and Benard in nature machine intelligence relies on to produ inability result it relies on an diffability result that actually is derived from epidemiology is the the constraint of no prevention where essentially this monotonicity constraint that is imposed in order to create a setting that things are identifiable and like contactual side identifiable those come from epidemiology simply first of all Point them towards that there's like thousands upon thousands of papers and pract practical like results that do showcase that causal way of thinking does work it is causal inference and both like and causal dis do work because in order to solve any problem you need to think in a causal manner you might not need to build an 100% causal model you might like get away with an approximate one for sure but the only only by employing these kind of reasoning techniques on what actually could affect it and like cut off and control for variables that might be affecting your results lead you to a better model and this is the true real life application and value of this of these things I wouldn't call caal infant only a modeling tool I would call it a way of reasoning a way of thinking about things and but if we want to be very specific about like modeling and Building C of models I seen a lot of Co models work very very well uh both in academic and Industrial like applications going back to your first point you said you would Point those people to years of research in econometrics in epidemiology probably a valid critical reply to this could be that many of those models actually failed right or to say this more generally that some people historically uh applied causal methods maybe ignoring assumptions or maybe being too optimistic regarding those assumptions which uh resulted in not very good uh performance of those models afterwards no for sure like uh it show me a feel that you build a model and like it always works there's no such feel like TPT for example like that makes no causal assumptions still kind of fails it hallucinates like badly and can provide you with very bad like answers uh my favorite my favorite Chad JP behavior is when it tells me I'm asking like hey is this paragraph correct in I don't know British American English because you know I write something longer I just it's it's very convenient and then it tells me like oh it's mostly correct but you should add a comma after this word then I look at this word and this is the last word in the sentence so it proposed that I add a comma before the period in the sentence and so this these are like amusing things right but when we think about this when we project it into some potential real world applications where serious stuff depends on this these kinds of mistakes and I think it's important to remember that these kinds of mistakes doesn't mean literally suggesting adding a comma this kind of mistake might might be any other mistake that translates from the latent space to whatever kind of output right that they might be very very risky if we think about applying those things in in the real world yeah absolutely like I totally agree with this and to be honest let's go back to the previous point that you said and the valid criticism like kind of you provide your own answer in that valid criticism that is these are assumptions like all these models that causal or not causal they are buil in assumptions as long as we make these assumptions explicit and be able to test them and realize when it works and when it doesn't work then we are okay in the same paper in the same paper that we produced with uh Kieran Berard in nature machine intelligence like one when we send it off to review one of the valid criticisms is that not everything is like monotonic sure of course not everything is monotonic but this is down to the ability of any form of analyst to realize when they should be using this tool you want to put up a frame in your bedroom with a nice like picture you're not going to be using a screwdriver you're going to probably be using a hammer to like Hammer the nail and like then hang the like the frame it's not there's no Panacea causality and causal modeling is not a Panacea but it can help you in a lot of circumstances I don't think there is a Panacea for anything really yeah I think that's a that's a very valid point and perhaps it's a natural cycle with any technology that if there is something new that forces us to question our own own assumption so our own mod operandi like the way we used to do things then we will be uh susceptible to finding flaws in this staff even if those flaws are something that is also present in staff that we are doing today but we are just not noticing the flaws in the stuff that we are doing today we are habituating the stuff but something new comes in like ah there's a holder yeah no no absolutely like uh this is our maybe inertia and of not wanting change and wanting like to remain at the status yes very Humane it's very Humane it's very natural it's not something that we should criticize people about it is something that is very natural and like comes with it but we should have an open mind at the end of the day it's something that we should kind of like be a bit Brave and like try to explore a bit like okay this looks promising let's explore a bit more into it see what happens sometimes these kind of bets don't work out for sure like uh I think there was like for example guns like the like generative adversar networks right like huge like thing and they kind of died off in popularity afterwards uh because people started probing into them like making them better like getting the elements of them that are very crucial and very good and using them continue using but other elements leaving behind and I think at the end of the day this is it while we probe and we try to figure out new things in technology and science and all that we will find we will find learnings and less that are very important and will keep them with us and some of them will leave aside that's again perfect like it is a natural course of things the guy who invited the ship also has invited the Shipwreck yeah sure exactly yeah they but like the ships are great right but yeah like this is uh this is something we need to like keep in mind like uh Science and Technology rarely if ever are linear paths they are paths with a lot of turns twists going up down back forwards everything and this is what is fun about this mode of exploring and having things to guide you like an idea to guide you for or like getting principles or expertise knowledge and a specific domain can help you go to from point A to point B faster sometimes it can even like ve you of course but like most of the times it is like the collective expertise of humanity is significant enough to like no okay that is is a fairly good way to go what is the craziest but still meaningful outcome of your Explorations maybe you started with cality but you went somewhere I I know you like like physics yeah I think oh that's a tough one I am a person that likes to explore a lot of academic things and uh I think that is very much evident in for example my both my undergrad and my PhD uh in the PHD it started off with uh forcement learning and computer vision ended up with well the computer vision kind of stuck around but like ended up uh with causality I think the most interesting thing that I discovered was how we can create this interdisciplinary world of research that uh we borrow things from different fields and combine them together and that was for example the paper that we did with a friend of mine who's a physicist from edur and again my two supervisors uh that was the minkovski SpaceTime paper that was very very fun again that that paper actually never got published anywhere it only got uh we only put it in an archive and then it got picked up by MIT tech review that was actually quite fun but in that paper it forced me to think and challenge a lot of assumptions one of the assumptions that it forced me to challenge uh was the one of the ukan for example space and I realized then and by reading papers from like 1964 and Zan that in order for example to have causality you need a lorenzian group space you can like causality does not emerge in a flat Idan space so if you want a latent space that has emerging causality in it you need to have such a space you cannot model things there and that's why for example I make some choices in building models in these weird ranian spaces but yeah I think that that was uh one of the craziest kind of like Explorations that I did in retrospect maybe like for some people in like the audience or the viewers or like audience it like might not sound that crazy but like back then it was for me quite quite out there and I still believe that paper is very much out there we'll link to the paper in the in the show notes and in the video description so everybody can judge for themselves how how the the level of craziness you can comment under the video just what how crazy is this paper between one and 10 yeah to be honest like this is like crackpot science is the best kind of science the scence like the friend science the science that challenges everything and tries to look at things in a different way this is where the magic happens in my opinion M what's the best thing about working at the advanced caal inference Lab at Spotify well there are two things really well multiple things now now that I think of it first of all it is actually working on Spotify Spotify is a great place it is a very collaborative one and a very open one and very artistic one in the sense that people are they can they want to Express themselves and they do that through their work and creates a very very nice and environment it's uh one of the few working environments that have been that the culture of this over the place is excellent another great thing on working in this lab is the expertise we have Kieran leading it we have Orel and Michael sh out to all the all the people there in the MIT in the ACI lab that are great that what they do like and each of us brings a different element and I think this is again goes back to the inter interdisciplinary kind of way of thinking a thing Kieran for example leading the group acknowledges this and I think the entire company acknowledges interdisciplinary thinking is key we have well I come from a background that is more like engineering electric engineering first computer science afterwards thinking about medical things working with medical things we have Oro that used to be a software engineer then went to research did a PhD and did research and is an expert in reinforcement learning we have Michael that used to deal with black holes he was an astrophysicist and then took a a turn and went to like research in like more data science and then research scientist here at Spotify and then we have Kieran that used to be a Quantum quum physicist dealing with Quantum Computing and now deals with causality and uh in a product sense it is this kind of like amalgamation of different expertises and different this Melting Pot of different people and different personalities that creates a very nice and unique result really that create like that Fosters creativity I've seen that before to be honest it's not only the first time that I see this but I'm very very happy that I found this here I've seen it in the in the set times uh that we were two machine learning people two solar physicists and one ionospheric physicist and that we try to predict the problems in the ionosphere because of solar weather they weirdly enough that actually worked uh it was like uh it is a very fun project that we did that but yeah this kind of interdisiplinary way of thinking created some excellent results and I've seen it it's not the first time that happens uh if you go even back in the kind of history of the industry you can go back to the 40s and 1940s and lo in Martin Lo in Martin there is skun Works which is kind of the experimental division of loid Martin and they even from the 40s and 50s they had created a very unique culture that is small teams very diverse teams that can move fast and like challenge this as and this is essentially what we kind of try to create here like we need to like be a diverse team because each one of us kind of brings a key element that can solve any problem I remember you mentioned working in causality in the context in the product context what are the main lessons that you learned working on causal modeling or causal thinking bro causal reasoning maybe more broadly in the context of product developing a product or improving a product the most surprising to be honest that it's like when you not surprising like it's surprising me at first but then in retrospect obvious it is that people regardless if they have been in contact with the for example the peran uh point of view or the ruin going uh potential outcomes they have an innate understanding of causality they might not call it causality they might call it something different it doesn't really matter they can understand it so this is the most crucial part because like the the stage is already set for us to go and like build up our things because people understand it any sort of person understands it because this is how we learn like from when we B we you say okay I push this it like pushed this mug it fell down cracked it was because of my movement that happened it didn't really spontaneously do this we are build maybe evolutionary I'm not an evolutionary biologist I have no idea I'm not a neuroscientist either so I'm just like speculating here we are kind of built to understand causality and the universe has causality so for us to create a product that bases itself on understanding and utilizing the these kind of Concepts is very easy because it is what we do by Nature so I think this is the most crucial thing it is much easier than it might have sounded in the very beginning because people do understand and do appreciate the power of this so like controlling for SP correlations it's obvious for them like in retrospect though not maybe not in the very beginning they may need a bit of convincing but in retrospect they say why didn't we do that already like uh it's it's such a powerful thing that's great what is one or two books that change your life I've read to be honest I've been reading a lot of books lately ever since the Pang make I realized I haven't been reading that much and like I I restarted uh reading a lot what are two books that change my life one of them was what was his name Clifford a pickover I read that a book of his back when I was u in high school and it really really struck with me because it was this book talking about time travel and um it was it was wonderful because at each chapter it had this girl with her friend who was an alien trying to go back to back in time to meet soen and on the other chapter he was kind of the author was explaining the various principles and the various like experiments that y did in the previous one so for sure that really struck me in like a it's it's such a like flashback to be honest like going back to that book but yeah so that was definitely one that kind of like I don't know how it affected me more than just like picked my curiosity about like things like physics things like again I guess causality comes into play when you deal with like time travel really because like can you be your own grandpa or something like that but yeah this is definitely a book that quite Shu like stuck with me and then more recently I guess I'm not going to go with the obvious kind of like book of why and stuff like this like this is too obvious for this podcast I am a massive fan of uh Umberto Eko the Italian author and pretty much anything that kind of like he has written I've read and like I loved mostly because he sets his books in a very historic environment and borrows heavily from actual history but then weaves in a very nice narrative and all of these kind of narratives have a bit of historical mystery for example like the name of the Rose you have like essentially a murder mystery set in like medieval times and it really really like gives you a very nice kind of like atmosphere like I do like books and movies and and songs that create a nice atmosphere and yeah the I think the name of the Rose or the fos pendulum both of them like have been like great but these are like fiction like the other one was kind of more non-fiction I think like it was funny because like I was like in kind of preparation to to this podcast I was listening to your older podcast like to the other episodes and I was listening to the one with Jacob and he mentioned like G the the very classic book to be honest I'm with you I have tried to read that book multiple times but I've failed consider like consistently maybe because it's like 700 pages and like very th but like it is such a great book but it's also kind of difficult to read for me at least for other people they might like flow through it this is at the top of my list I still have it in the good reads as currently reading and it's something that I I really want to now you made now you made me even more curious about this about this book although I I heard about this book from multiple times in my life always from people who who's like sensitivity or knowledge I I really all appreciated them just as as as people so I I think it's a recommendation that I cannot say no to yeah I think I think you should give it a chance at least yeah I should who knows where where it where where will this lead me why do you think coal Discovery is a better riddle than coal infer well because it's plain and simple more difficult it is more exciting because you're trying to figure out how things are causally connected like causal inference makes some assumptions the assumption that you know the dag you know that X causes y things like this and Under the Influence froming other factors but these assumptions and this knowledge that we have is first of all not doesn't span the entirety of the cosmos We There are lot of things that we don't know why they happen I can give you an example afterwards a very AP example uh from my experience and then we might be mistaken we might be making things while all our data might be pointing one way but at the end of the day there's some like key thing that we have actually missed or it hasn't happened yet because it's rare that would change the way we're thinking of things and these are like these are assumptions that like would challenge the dags for example that we have built but causal Discovery tries to identify these dags they try to figure out that actually X causes y from maybe from some like uh expert knowledge that kind of informs it but at the end of the day it is a very very difficult task that's such an interesting one for example in the let me give you two examples here the one of a thing that we know we have good hints of what is going on but we don't actually knew and that is the work that we did for example with at the CTI at the CTI Institute revolved around the impurities the ionosphere that causes problems in the bands that gnss works gnss when I say gnss think of GPS the commercial name of gnss in the US is GPS in Europe is I think Copernicus something like that in Russia is glassos or something that some something there but dnss is kind of like the over scientific name of it these happen around the poles and the science and the physics why they're happening these impurities is very well understood because like chars particles kind of come from solar wind etc etc and they get trapped by the magnetic field of the Earth but they also happen around the equator and that is a more troubling thing because we we have hints on why they are and we can you can talk to a like ion fake physicist or solar physicist they they will tell you more than I can but like we are not 100% certain why this happens and this is an interesting one because there you need to discover a new part of physics a new causal relationship that you don't know yet this is very very exciting from a more mundane let's put it example you go to again the medical field you're trying to understand and model essenti is going the very like beginning of this podcast about and the comment and Hinton and in order to like model this radios you need to model the way you're thinking you need to discover the the causes and the links between the elements that they have in their minds and you for example look the only access you have really you cannot really probe their minds you you need to look at the observational data you have and these are the test for example that they have ordered for the patient and you might have things that are missing that is not missing at random there is a cause on why these are missing you need to identify what that cause is and this is in my opinion truly interesting and uh very very very challenging Coastal Discovery at the end of the day it is it is science either you want it or not it is the process that we do science we're trying to see if there is a causal link from X to y or from y to X we can try to make models out of it and try to formalize things that's great you can ENT have science derived from data wonderful sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't but like caal Discovery at the end of it I find it more interesting because it's more difficult and also it is true science the others is applied science it's technology but like it's exploration called Discovery you're trying to find out something you don't know and this is wonderful it is like that essence of exploration is really really captivating me yeah it also touches the maybe a vulnerable place of of us H humans uh because it leads us to the edge of of what we know and what we don't know yeah absolutely it leads us to the to the frontier to the final frontier like uh kind of going back to Star Trek that you mentioned in the beginning like Star Trek is a brilliant example of how in popular culture how we as humans think think about Discovery and exploration because it is it is a set of people both humans and aliens in a spaceship flying away in the middle of nowhere exploring new worlds and new civilizations like boldly go where no man has gone before it's like it's wonderful it is the human element it is innate in our nature this essence of exploration we had exploration by like uh when people kind of migrated away from Africa into the rest of the world like thousands upon thousands of years ago you had Explorations when they would try to reach the highest peak or the lowest depth you had a like a sense of exploration to like go up in the the Arctic or the Antarctic and like kind of see what is there it is this and this is also going of be this is also shown in this discovery of new science when like Galileo I don't know to be honest I I was taught that in school and I I never actually check whether or not this is true just like an anecdotal story that he was like in P or in somewhere in Italy and he was like rolling balls and trying to figure out how fast they fall I think it is true like because I've seen it in multiple like multiple kind of things but like it's it's also a story that like 600 years old so like you never can be sure but this is an essence of explanation trying to understand the why things happen and how like in that case how fast the ball would fall in a vacuum things like this if it is our innate drive to understand the world and this is perfectly en culated for example in causal Discovery because it is causal Discovery the other the day you might not use machine learning models back then they might have been us like they're using just like pure experimentation but it is causal Discovery in a sense and this is why it is for sure more interesting but also more more difficult way more difficult maybe the reason why I do Cal difference is because it is easier it is like I can see I don't need to wait uh and test thoroughly hundreds thousands of possible causes I can just do the infant and make make a some assumptions and produce a very nice result and very nice product but if you want blue sky research yes for sure Cal Discovery is the way to go I really loved U your your description of of what science is and all this all this Vision you shared with us here thank you one thought that I have here is that perhaps today in this world of technology that is everywhere and it's easy to forget that we actually live in the world where we don't know many things so you have Wikipedia at your fingertips everything around you oh depends where in the world you live and how like you were but if you live in in a reasonably uh rich country everything around you kind of works well every day so this is an environment that is not inspiring us to to ask questions and go behind not necessarily it hides from us a lot of the fact that we don't know so so many things and I think this is a great example that you gave with with uh the uh how did you call it gnss yeah yeah with gnss or GPS and about the situation or the scenario around equator that we we are not able to explain it with uh as much certainty as as we can explain the the phenomena on the on the polls I think it's a great example because we live in the world where we leave where we believe most of us that physics is solved and like anything regarding physics is just like trivial today yeah that is a really really far from the truth like I to a certain to a certain extent I do agree uh to a certain extent yes maybe because every we have reached the point in Civilization that things work fairly okay as lots of asterisks next to the Fairly okay thing but like let's say like let's leave it to the technological level a lot of our technology works very nicely they have we have achieved the level of technology that like create comfort in our lives but the thing is don't forget that this is for example what the victorians might have thought as well like and the Victorian era technology to today is starkly different to a certain extent I agree how however there are still loads thousands upon millions of people that still have this drive and to be honest when challenged people are very inventive and they are very much explorers in at heart well kind of depends on the person of course but we are like almost 8 billion of us for sure there are some and these are the people that are pushing the limits and trying to find new things you see them either in the Arts you see them in science and technology you see them in politics and everywhere they we are trying to change the world to a collective better thing and this is wonderful and yeah you we might rest upon our lers sometimes for sure but as if we average it out to be honest I don't think that we do think we are still pushing M because we want to push it is built in our nature it is interesting it is what kind of drives us everybody wants to create a better life for themselves and this is essentially that materializes in different ways and sometimes it materializes with significant advances in science and technology and these kind of things do come in weird ways just as I said before and like in the very beginning that like just by thinking about a problem for example in a cal manner you have a lot of like interesting kind of off suits and like side effect effects that uh that happen same with science technology we might be pushing towards one thing we for example loads of loads of progress happened through what we call big science that is for example during the second world war there was a drive for like scientific research in order to like gain advantage in a worldtime scenario but that that had a lot of other like side effects for example Rader that we use like to control aircraft like now or in the space race again we had lots of like they we were like racing to who reaches the moon but like in the meantime you had a lot of other advances I if I'm not mistaken aluminium foil came about like this like I use constantly in my kitchen to like wrap like uh things that that I put in the fridge or if you go down to even more Blue Sky Reeses and more like fundamental physics reses and you have the LHC in in CERN in Geneva off suits of uh the work we have done and side effects of the work we have done in CERN as Humanity first all is the World War web is the inter like part of the internet it is all these super magnets and that we need to build better MRIs and like help people diagnose whatever they have science is I think I mentioned that before is not a linear thing it is very much all over the place and it is the essence of exploration that kind of drives us we might rest in our low sometimes but even if you look and you try to push forwards the limit of something that sounds mundane at the end of the day you might actually figure out something that nobody else has this unique solution that makes your product for example work better or makes it more attractive etc etc still these are contributions this is still a sense of exploration are we don't need to like be pushing for the stars all of us but like like as many as people as we can yes it would be amazing even the small contributions matter there's no contribution small enough not matter everybody makes a valuable contribution to society I strongly believe that who would you like to than everybody no like the classic thing as any any sort of you know how in the Oscars they they say a lot of uh things it is Oscar season right now like a kind of word season in the Arts but yeah like obviously my parents like they both of them have influenced me in ways that seen and unseen so like my mother is a doctor so she kind of like uh pushed me this kind of like medical like even through like just discussing things like I I got to know a lot of medicine through her my dad I think definitely influenced me in the sense of the exploration mostly because of all the Star Trek that we have watched together and he was talking about is like definitely build a smaller exploring at least in like science and technology and uh then all my friends and collaborators to be honest like like Kieran here the rest of the ACI lab Berard and Daniel my PhD supervisors all the people that have collaborated over the years I think science and technology is never won much job like it is a collective effort of a lot of people that some of them might go unnamed but their contributions remain very valuable and very crucial and also like all the people that just go to the to the pub after have to work with because the best ideas do come at the pub like in a in a relaxed kind of environment when like there's a free flowing like uh free flowing ideas this is where like the magic happens so yeah pretty much everybody have I have ever interacted with I thank you for having me here everybody I have interacted with because they have contributed to everything that we have done together if there was one thing that you could solve in in caly today what would that be a way to create even from observational data like I'm saying something that is kind of proven not to be but like it to be the case but like if I could like change the world change the rules of nature in such way that it could happen from observation data get accurate and meaningful bounds in uh like various like contacts I know this is not the case I know this is impossible unless we put a lot of assumptions in and a lot of like constraints but like if I were to change the world so it could be like that yes that would be amazing that would simplify my life considerably and assuming that we cannot change the the fundamentals something that if you could distribute like1 billion dollars for for causal research what would you invest in a lot of causal Discovery because it will help the world greatly and the other one is kind of like education like in terms of like realizing what causality is because cality as I said is embedded in our beings it is there even if people might not causality but like being able to realize the spish correlations being like skeptic about everything that we see around us will not only help science technology will help the world around us in general like Society because then we would like the burden of proof would kind of like rise so like we need to be more accurate in what we do more logical about what do what we do without I don't want to be like Spock and like get get like emotion aside we still emotion all that but like we this would help us think of the world in a way that will decrease not minimize decrease the amount of mistakes we do because we do make mistakes so these are the two things like a billion dollars I would 75% of that to causal Discovery like efforts and applying causal Discovery in every single imaginable field of science and technology and then going to the education part the other 25% goes to the education part what question would you like to ask me well I was kind of thinking about that to be honest the yeah uh the I know that you used to be like a music producer and we are in a music company here like listening is everything is literally our motto and so like the very easy question I have to ask for you like to use what is your favorite Xandra and your favorite like kind of song that like what is your top song like in your uh Spotify 2023 wrapped I don't know if I can disclose this now but I don't have Spotify on my phone sad reacts but uh my favorite genre well that's a very difficult one but very broadly speaking I I like two broad streams in music one is like EDM like very energetic electronic music I love the energy I love the clarity there m I love the emotion it depends on the sub genre but for sure yeah and the second one is like some kind of acoustic expressive music which involves stuff like jazz like flamco various kinds of like you know Crossovers and and so on and so on so I I really love emotion in music uh I think this is like so Fus fundamental you like like Fusion stuff like a fusion stuff I like as well yeah that's the an album by by Herby Hancock which I forgot the title of the album uh but they are basically he he collaborates with pop artists the NJ artists and they are rearranging popular songs so he's harby hanok is doing a lot of reharmonization so he takes the melody and then change the chords in in ways that are like maybe not completely obvious and so there's a there's a remake that of the song the song goes on with Chaka Kan yeah and that's uh insane I love it I love this one it's super Dynamic uh it's also I think there's also Anushka Shankar then on on on sitar Chaka Kan singing Herby hancook on piano and um yeah and there are some more people so like uh again like a follow-up thing yeah like I I I get the sense that you kind in agreement in the point of the interdisciplinary thing Fusion of ideas and fusion of like expertises creates nice things you had like you have like Herby Han Coke that comes from more Jazz thing you have ch you have like all this kind of thing going into one M poll and creating a beautiful song so I think this is a learning that we can take not only in music but in life in general bringing different people and different ideas together always leads to something nice well I I I very much agree with this um I think I I never understood the fully maybe the challenge that we as Humanity are facing with um with clashing tribes which we see a lot today around the world because I was maybe always curious about what is on the other side and sometimes maybe because of uh different historic uh experiences it might be more difficult to us and sometimes building those bridges might be might be very challenging especially when the trust is low yeah yeah for sure but like I think it is we need to we need to try yeah I agree with I agree with this and I think this also uh goes back to what you said about your work here that you talked about loit Martin and those small teams and those small teams are great are building a great Environ built a high trust uh configuration where people can even if they are different they're coming from different tribes Let It Be scientific tribes or different ethnicities different life stories and so on they can build those bridges easier and we have research in Psychology showing that people doing stuff together is is one of the best predictors of Building Bridges between two different uh tribes that might be even conflicted so I wish us all in science and outside science that we have more bridges and less walls absolutely yeah funny enough come like uh kind of anecdotal evidence uh it was like almost a decade ago there was um there was an effort I want to say from MIT or was it Caltech that in physics people were debating kind of conflicting views on subject I think was like strength Theory something like that and some some of them thought it would be a good idea and actually was a brilliant idea to have the major proponents of one field and the other field debate each other but by supporting the other person's point of view and that created such an good understanding between them on actually what is each one is the saying and then that kind of led to like more of an EAS in the conflict let's put like this like a bigger understanding more collabor more collaboration and it was so like it was beautiful and to be honest like strongly we agree with you like we have to build more bridges and not walls F before we close for those uh in our audience uh who are interested in cety would like to learn more or maybe just are just starting with with this topic what resources would you recommend to them well kind of depends on where they're coming from where is like what the background is because other people learn by doing things other people learn by reading reading things so like your book for example is a great resource Pearl's book is another great resource s's book is uh another great resource all these are like textbooks are everywhere like uh medium articles and stuff like this if people are going to Big in this day and age a lot of people just prefer that so like they can they are blog post plenty doing that the key thing I think is in my opinion and the way I learned is and this is in how I learn is by doing like I picking up a small kind of idea that you might have a small little project trying to see what would happen if you just didn't very associational kind of point of view what would happen like if you had a cultural point of view and that will essentially give the experience to the person and the Insight on why we're doing things like this and how we should be doing things my my true kind of recommendation is read up sure learn the basics but then go out and try because this is how we learn or at least I learn where can people connect with you and learn more about you and and your research so uh Spotify in general has like a a research blog that we post things that we make public there in more personal level and things outside of Spotify well I am active in most if not all social platforms so like uh X formerly known as Twitter you can find me with my last name lones uh you can find me in LinkedIn and or just drop me an email and let's grab a coffee I'm I'm in London I'm based in London which is a wonderful City and like I'm always up for a pine and or coffee thank you so much that was a wonderful conversation thank you for having having me thank you
