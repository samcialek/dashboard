I really hope it's not a trend it's fundamental for Humanity in the sense it's really about decision- making a framework to have a better decision- making process curiosity is key component here hey causal Bandits welcome to the causal Bandits podcast the best podcast on causality and machine learning on the internet today we're going back to Berlin to meet our guest born and raised in bogot Columbia he did his PhD in geometric analysis before geometric deep learning became popular he attended some of the most prestigious conferences in his field just to realize that pure math doesn't make him happy he decided to make a transition to data science and became one of the leading advocates for using causality in marketing ladies and gentlemen Dr Juan orus let me pass it to your host Alex molak ladies and Gentlemen please welcome Hanan U hi hola hola all good thank you I am very happy to to have you here beautiful thank you for having me here it's a pleasure actually I I guess coming to Berlin is always a pleasant thing for me definitely and I love the apartment I love the I love this openness here and the and the space thanks it seems you you really love Berlin what what's so special about the city for you well uh actually I came to Berlin 12 years ago because I got a a scholarship to continue with my graduate status in math yeah living as a student in Berlin is really great because you get exposed various type of universities a lot of young people a lot of diversity and energy after that actually I tried to escape from Berlin just because I wanted to do something else but I couldn't because I like the city so much and I think it comes to the fact that it it provides so much diversity so much energy and and things to do that actually it's perfect City it seems that your career is also diverse you did your PhD in pure math uh but now you work in a very applied context yeah I guess I get bored pretty easily I would say and that kind of bring brings me to try to explore different type of fields so I guess even at the very beginning I I started with physics and I was very into particle physics but then I realized that I like particle physics not because of the physics but because of the geometry so I think I I find it quite nice to have this nonlinear path and and let's see what's going to happen next and how was the transition for you from the academic thinking and the academic culture to to to the industry so I mean I guess when I started the PHD I kind of wanted to continue with the academic path but then life happens I was doing research in a very specific field which I like quite a lot but I realized kind of the impact and kind of people that would qu appreciate my work was very limited and also I spent five years just talking with mathematicians so at some point you feel like it's not the the real world and kind of the breaking point was that I was at the fields Institute in Canada attending one of the the most kind of prestigious conference in my field ER and I was not happy I was away from my family I was I get away from from my friends and I was like okay even if I stay here longer I wouldn't enjoy it and and at that time I kind of went to a library and actually I bought one of these books that I still have that is called data science for D just because why not and and then I guess at that time that was already SE September 2016 ER I was very close to finishing my PhD thesis and then I started this moment in life to try to think about what could be next I had no idea I was lucky enough to to to meet some people in Berlin again that's nice think about berin you meet a lot of different type of people and I talked about what they'll do and a former the student of my graduate school was actually doing data science and among all of the possibilities that that I heard that felt the most interesting for me it was not that hype at the moment so I didn't choose that because it was kind of hot but I generally thought it was like a good field for me to to apply it what I had learned and then but I also aware that I had to start from scratch again so really trying to understand these these data problems from a business perspective and not academic point of view and that was pretty tough I would say mhm does the perspective of pure mathematics have help you when you deal with applied stuff absolutely absolutely because math doesn't give you like just theorems or or tooling but it just it teach you how to learn to solve problems so when I faced with a very hard problem in Industry because of various Reason Not Just because it's hard by itself then I always think okay let's do it one step at a time let's try to break out break up the the problem and then take piece by piece and not get overwhelmed by a problem kind of you're not scared to tackle something which might be IL defined and on the other hand you of course have a a very strong toolbox for example think about linear algebra I always think about and talk about linear algebra as fundamental feel uh where if you have kind of good knowledge about it then most of what people do in the in the industry can be reduced to a certain type of linear algebra problems so in that case kind of it gives you the fun fals and in addition kind of disrespective to tackle problems and not get scared the first time you see it in your blog post that you that you share with the community you very often use use ban methods um and at some point I notice writing your your post your blog post and and um everything you share that there's more and more content that is related somehow to to causality what was the what was the point in your life when you realize that this causal thinking might be something that can be helpful for you and the problems that you deal with yeah so I guess I knew I needed causality from the very beginning because one of my first yeah positions was dealing with yeah marketing analytics and marketing problems and kind of the way they wanted to kind of estimate for example media efficiency or optimized budget was using kind of traditional uh physical model let's say linear regression of course they wanted to test many things and I guess the recipe was to throw everything into the model and try to hope for the best and do kind of really kind of I don't know strange tricks which didn't feel natural to get out of this outcome so you could always torture the data to get a story I was always thinking like there should be a better way but I did not know about the the language and I guess because of different reasons I turn yeah my attention into B modeling uh one of these great books about the topics which I strongly recommend is this book statistical rethinking by Richard mcer and I mean the book is really about uh basan statistics but with a focus in in in cality so there's a like a chapter about DXs and confounders and I remember the first time I read that I was like okay what the hell is that like I no idea what the guy is talking about but it seems like a very very powerful tool and and I guess it was not just because of the proper conceptual or academic interest but really because I saw as as a potential Tool uh to help me solve the problems that I had faced in the past ER and and I think through that and kind of resources which were not that popular at that time not is like as I had your book at that time ER I kind of made my way into try to understand this better but really into in the applied setting what are the main differences that you see in causal approach versus versus traditional approach that we see in in Industry today especially in the context of marketing where where most of your expertise is today yeah I mean I guess the challenge is really because it's it's a such a I wouldn't say complicated topic but something that you really need to to to structure in a kind of conceptional framework that people might get scared or lost so just to give you a very concrete example thinking U media mix model problems where you want to estimate media efficiency by putting I don't know cost or Impressions to try to explain a Target variable like conversions kind of the the intuition that marketeers have is that you need to just throw all the data or all the channels into into the mix so that they compete each other in this regression framework and then you get some return investment or variable importance but the problem is that the marketing funnel is rather complex because you have a kind of TV for example out of home or or paid a social try to create awareness but there are other channels like search which are already in between uh these initial touch points and the final conversion because you you see an ad you get interest and then you potentially search about it and then you get the conversion so this is kind of a mediator effect and if you just throw everything into a model it's going to give you bias estimation it's not going to work H what you need to do is really identify which channels and which type of EX you want which in essence is WR the dck of of your assumptions and based on that you might need to run one or a couple of models to actually extract this this effects but for people it's really hard ER to to grasp the fact that to get good estimations for media efficiency you need to leave certain channels out H just because you're going to create or like it's they're going to mask the effects and it's hard to communicate and and of course I can not just come with with Pearl's book on causality to try to explain that to marketeers it's really trying to get intuition into something that might not be intuitively easy to understand what are tools that that you are using uh in order to communicate with with stakeholders or with people who are in marketing and and maybe are not as technical as you or other data scientists might be yeah actually I I found that trying to go with pure Theory or or or kind of fundamental arguments is not is not very successful at least in my experience and you need to show them something like prove something and this is where I see simulations as a great tool because you control the truth and you can tell them okay I run a simulation I simulated a couple of uses and I know that the return investment of this Channel or the effect of this intervention or campaign is positive and then let's do uh like let's put everything into the model and and see what we get and we can get like really misleading results and not that they're slightly wrong but like very wrong which can actually can make you take decisions which can make you lose a lot of money so when you show them the effect and say I know the truth this is what we get if we do it kind of a naive way then they get like more convinced without needing into get into the details of of Cal inference and and and the concept behind it it seems that basan framework in terms of bean structural let's call it modeling is a very well uh suited tool for this purpose because it it's a natural it's a natural way to work with these models to simulate the data to just allow the information FL flow through the model and sample from the model yeah I mean I guess what I really like about the patient framework is that it force you to explicitly State your assumptions on the data generation process so if you want to run a simulation then you need to think this prop properly and of course you you want to also understand let's say where this variance or variability is coming from and that's we're kind of setting up certain type of distribution and also putting some domain knowledge into that it it's really helpful because you you really want to have the simulations in a scale that the user can understand so Euros conversions and so on and so forth so you really need to understand ER what are your assumptions so that I mean based on that you would get certain results and in that regard kind of the break framework thinking about the data generation process comes very handy and when thinking about Cal D so it's not like like a huge step but it it becomes kind of natural uh yeah thinking about this uh this kind of data problem in as a cal structure was the fact that you uh that you have experience in physics and then basion modeling helpful for you to go into causality I think at least what you get from physics H it's really try to model the phenomena without over complicating it meaning that of course really trying to extract a cal structure from The Real World it's it's very hard and if you want to do it perfectly then you're probably not going to do anything that because it's it's very hard but then you can start simple okay let us simplify what's the essence of the problem what's the most fundamental thing that you believe you can model and parameterize in a way that it it makes sense and then you start adding kind of complexity and experimenting with the data so it's not that you always need to go to the most complete do or more more complex problem you start simple and iterate and in that case I guess the the the background in physics for example I guess particularly is where these ideas have helped me quite a lot what what tools what causal tools did you find most helpful in the beginning of your of your journey with cality tooling as in kind of books software or or like I meant more on a conceptual level at this at this stage I mean I I did kind of face the this problem of trying to understand the Dack and kind of what could go wrong for example what if we condition a collider so that was hard but it was actually the the way that I I found it more useful so to say so it it took me some effort I wouldn't say this was for free but having the concept of of a model as a graph such that you just estate your assumptions and then pass this to a software or do calculus or whatever and then you don't need to kind of Be Clever about it but really systematically and conceptually get H the model structure that you need to estimate let's say in a in a linear regression so I really like the concept of thinking about the problem as a dock I think it's very naturally you think about noes and connections but it of course takes some time to get into the framework but definitely thinking about D make everything much transparent what would you say to people who want to start with causality and they feel a little bit intimidated or unsure how to construct their their first dock maybe they are a little bit afraid that it will be incorrect or they feel they don't have necessary experience I mean first of all I don't think it's easy and as Richard Mark ER would say if you're feeling un comfortable and Confused is because you're following H I would say it takes a bit even I feel sometimes comfortable because again it's really about stating their assumption but it definitely pays off so so it's really an investment and even with the very basic fundamentals like okay I have a simple model which variables do I need to add into the model to have a proper estimation without including any type of bias that's already a big win so the seeing it as an investment which is definitely going to pay off like a guarantee that it's going to pay off bring kind of momentum and energy to people getting into the field mhm and you mentioned this iterative process that sometimes you start with something simple then you add something then maybe you run a simulation how do you communicate with stakeholders the the value of this process I mean first of all we should always get simpler because of the speed right so let us assume I want to solve specific problem certain time they need some results right if we start with something complex it's going to take longer H it's going to be riskier of course it's going to get a it's not going to be easy to get the Buy in so if you state something simple and think about what what's the easiest thing you could do that makes sense then you can deliver that and start working on top so that people kind of get an impression of what's the end result and how is it going to look like and see how they will use it for decision making and then iterate on top of that so thinking about additional features or uncertainty quantification if this something that they really want to use H you might po that for the second iteration so really trying to think about it as a as an iterative process because at the very end kind of at least in in Industry kind of speed and and when having result it's important so I mean if you're going to have a perfect model in a year that's pretty much useless right because we need to make decisions now mhm you are now in in in a professional transition so you used to be a senior data scientist at wal in the marketing team and now you trans iing to the pricing and forecasting team what are the main challenges that you see in this transition regarding the approach to modeling approach to causality well I did work a bit I mean at at hello fresh in in forecasting but it was a kind of smaller scale I was doing what is called strategical forecast or strategic kpi to make specific driven decisions of course we want to do this in a automated way and scalable way but we're talking about maybe 20 to 100 time series now what we face at B is really like a massive ER set of of Time series so you really need to make sure that the the scope and the variables and the methods you choose should scale well right so so I guess that's the difference like you won't be able to see and analyze all of Time series you want to really kind of extract the main features in in a cleever way and in a way that it's scaled but I still think kind of again coming back to to where I find things interesting like changing fields and seeing how one can kind of include Knowledge from one to another and also keep learning is actually something that I find very interesting mhm today uh one of the super hot topics is the intersection of causality and large language models uh looking from a perspective of a person working in marketing pricing and forecasting do you find any areas where this could be useful in in your work I should say that kind of following both the literature in cultural inference Bas statistics and the rest of the field is very challenging so I might not I probably don't know enough about llms to to really answer this I do see there's a lot of potential regarding creativity and kind of thinking about whether you could kind of optimize the way you communic with people in a kind of automated way and be be able to experiment a little bit more but I think in a very early days because again when you do marketing and you have a campaign you really need to be careful about the message and the way you communicate the tone and kind of letting kind of such a model to to do this for you can actually H the bad so kind of what if the model has a an outlier or unexpected response then that can hurt your brand quite a lot so I guess at least for me what I feel that these type of uh models help is actually boosting my productivity through for example GitHub co-pilot and a lot of this kind of um productivity tools to actually speed up the process but with respect to specific marketing I think we're still in the early days but maybe I haven't followed the latest uh Trends recently M so you find it useful for for just speeding up your work making more efficient absolutely absolutely I Tred to use it as as much as possible thinking about code also thinking about uh text summarization also and kind of summarizing calls and and things that you can automate this is something that definitely I use quite a lot which causal tools are the most useful in your in your toolbox in your work I guess thinking about again going back to the fundamentals I guess once you have the dock and you have specified the problem then you can actually move forward very fast so I guess in that sense we're kind of agnostic I guess if you have the concept properly stated is it's going to be it's going to be fine if the model is simple enough I usually run kind of do it myself PC fans so I will probably write mod myself if it get more complex or you need anything more sophisticated there's no reason to rebuild everything anything from scratch so kind of popular python libraries out there like do Eon ml uh definitely have been very useful for for my work mhm when you think about methods coming from different causal Traditions let's call them uh so we have this graphical tradition that comes from Pearl we have the potential outcomes framework and methods that come from econometrics synthetic control or other quasa experimental methods do you use both of them and are there any ways that that you try to combine those two different schools of thought yeah I guess maybe I'm a little bit of an outsider because kind of I haven't followed the the details kind of in in a way where I can see how this Branch I actually believe they complement each other quite well so I started looking into rubin's approach on on potential outcomes it was much easier for me to understand it makes sense and when you need to have certain type of estimations and you need to pick up the set of regressors in just in such a way that you have a proper structure to do the estimation then in that regard kind of having a a graphical model and having the two calculus to automate this for you comes very handy so I don't see them at least in my work as kind of two separate branches I I see if you can combine them together to get the best H out of both worlds what would be the main advantages uh of using Dax when when you already use quasa exp experimental methods again I think that Dack independently on whether if you are going to do cultural inference or statistics or any type of analysis it force you to State your assumptions and that's hard but once you have done that then you are aware about what could be the potential limitations or whether it might be unfeasible to run such a estimation from the observational data that you have so even if you turn if you don't use the dck itself to specify your model uh thinking about the data generation process the connections again going from simple to complex is something that is going to make your work more transparent again because how explicit you need to be in when doing so and this advice is on fire I think everybody should hear this because we we sometimes might forget that quas experimental methods do not guarantee qua identification out of the box which sometimes depending where you started your journey you can get an impression that that is the case so some people might expect that if we use synthetic control for instance there's no chance that we will have some hidden confound fing but as long as we do not dra we do not have a structural model we actually cannot exclude this possibility yeah absolutely absolutely and I'm always very careful about U kind of not trusting the data and trying to challenge my own assumptions and just wrong the that which again people might feel is the hard part and I do feel the harder part because then you really need to think about the problem and and the domain H but again this is kind of the great starting point and then yeah this is like a m but it it takes time to get this and actually acknowledge that this is going to help you instead of being kind of a blocker or like a uh like something that it might be unnecessary complex to solve a specific business problem mhm when somebody is just starting uh W with causality and they want to do it specifically in Python what will be your advice where should they start would it be go and do stuff with PMC with Dy eonl maybe some other pack PES so actually I like quite a lot the approach of this book Cal inflence the Brave and The True by matto uh because he he actually builds up kind of the con the concepts and uses stats models for the for the estimation so he's not focused on the estimation or whether we use bation or or frequencies or or even the P values but it's more about the the the structure right so I guess at the very beginning you should be focused on the concept and not be distracted by the estimation because once you have that then you can just select your favorite Library what I would advise not to do is just get choose a library because it's hot and try to make a like put a lot of data and hope for the best really focus on the fundamentals if you need to write your linear regression in r or we're talking about python but in stats model for example that's already a great start I wouldn't kind of over complicate things at the beginning by combining very ious type of estimation methods so that sounds like starting from from the scratch and building those models on a little bit like lower level yeah which is fine because again if you understand the fundamentals everything's going to be easier later but if you have your if the bases are kind of weak at some point that's going to bite you in the future and things going to become very confusing and then you don't know if it's because the library is broken or you don't know the concepts well or somewhere in between this approach reminds me of of what we what we can experience in mathematics as well if you skip something in the beginning then it might be very very hard to build a more advanced or more complex concept later on yeah and I guess coming back to to this point when you have certain type of math problem you have this theorem of a structure of a theorem where you says let us assume this and then you have a a a result which means what you need is actually essential and if you you take one of these hypothesis the result might break and when you start proving theorems you don't want to start from very weak conditions but actually very strong ones and see up to which point you can remove unnecessary conditions to get the minimal set of assumptions so that your result holds true MH we had a lunch a couple of days ago together and we had this very interesting conversation about related to your PhD about symmetry uh in in in physics in in very fundamental uh view on the structure of reality of or what we want to understand as reality is there any way that you see that this thinking about symmetries can be also useful in modeling absolutely I think I think it's it's essential and again comes to the fact of this kind of wellknown theorem not's theorem we would say at least in in physics that whenever you have a a symmetry there's a conserved quantity so if you have for example rotational symmetry H then the angular momentum is conserved so even if it this feels quite a bit away from modeling or even industry the message is clear like if you see there's some pattern let's say symmetry then you can use that to be more efficient in your computation so just to give you a very concrete example H where this kind of gets Illustrated quite well if you have two circles which are in the same Center but with different radius and you want to split these two H with a cluster anorm you cannot use K means I have that example in my blog and you can do something fanc for example Spectra clustering but if you realize about kind of the Symmetry you actually if you express this in polar coordinates where you have the radius and the angle then you can actually forget about the angle and in the radial space this is is linearly separated so of course you could try something more complex like H Spectra clustering but you really think about the problem and see okay actually I can I have this symmetry if I use that in my advantage I can actually reduce the problem to something very very simple it reminds me of what we do in causality sometimes as well so if we are able to fulfill certain assumption so we say hey in this case we can get something for free if if an assumption holds then we could could do things in a much simpler way right with maybe interventions or simulating interventions or even Computing counterfactuals yeah yeah exactly this is where you let's say again it it everything or not everything but most of things come come to geometry and the symmetries that you are looking into can come into different type of structures but I guess the most common structure is in in geometric object so thinking about the the circle examples is really the space of the point and in this case in in the Cal setting it would be the duck itself when we talk about the causality and in particular pan causality we have this hierarchy of of of causal levels or rangs of the letter of causation and as it is metaphorically expressed sometimes when we move from Association for interven interventions towards counterfactuals we can think about having different formal languages for each of the ranks and each language gives a richer description of of a phenomenon is there any association here that you could could do with the idea or concept of symmetry here the richness of structure The Riches of description with assumptions maybe but I don't have anything on on top of my mind but I do agree that kind of going from one level to another it has to be about language and and kind of Concepts about how you cannot use just the do operator to do contrafactual kind of calculus so to say so I guess not at the moment but again I'm not really a researcher so I'm more F practitioner but I wouldn't be surprised that this type of of tool can actually help us uh to get a more efficient yeah understanding especially when we it comes back to to estimation and inference in marketing uh we sometimes use those methods uh called geolift for many people that come from the outside of marketing this concept seems or might seem uh very very complex could you give our audience a little bit bit of an Insight how those models can be constructed and if they are really really very complicated uh I mean whether it's complicated or not I guess it depends on the background but I would say in essence what you're trying to do H is to is to actually have a a way or a tool to estimate the a contrafactual so let let's have a very concrete example let's say that you're are going to run a campaign in Berlin and you don't have a control group so to say You're going to to have like maybe a TV campaign or with out of homes or a big one and you want to estimate what could be the outl of the or the impact of that on certain kpi let's say conversions so because of business requirements and also visibility you cannot split Berlin into two you just to have the Hall of Berlin so the question is if I want to kind of test incrementality I don't want to just see the the whether there was an uplift on conversion but the uplift relative to the contrafactual which would be what would have been the development of conversions without any campaign or intervention so you this is like a simulating an alternative world where where something exactly but you don't have two berlins so you need to proxy that one possibility is use a city which has a very similar development of conversion so let's say Hamburg and of course you need to draw many assumptions saying okay they are comparables to certain degree and this is where your duck come very handy because maybe actually the the conversion development of Hamburg and Berlin No matter how close they are could not be as close in that space so to say so so for example Munich H Berlin and if you have one or many you can actually use time based regression or synthetic control to with other type because maybe H work is not enough but you want to have a better estimation of the contrafactual with many cities and then you estimate what would have been the conversion development m in Berlin without campaign and then you can estimate that gap of course the devil is in the details so how do I select the GEOS or what about boundaries and to which extent uh this is a correct approximation I think this depends on on the problem itself and there are many ways of solving this but again depend on the on the context but in essence that's what you want so it's not it's actually not that hard it's it's hard to plan of course because you need to syn which C is to to control but it's definitely not a silver bullet but really convenient one because yeah there's some cases where you cannot do like a proper split Lo or or an AB test how well in your experience those methods work in practice it can work surprisingly well so under kind of very mild assumptions you can get very good estimations H and again in in Industry of course you care about the accuracy but also you need to get something right a possibility would be so instead of having a Geo experiment to simply try to estimate the contr factual with a Time series model like a cal impact where you have a patient time structure model and try to just predict that but then you're putting all the weight into the Model H and this not easy I mean predicting the future is pretty hard and usually you have quite big uncertainty band so instead of making kind of forcing the model to get to to solve the problem for you what what you then do is actually do this GEOS spit have a much simpler model let's say a linear regression or a synthetic control to have better estimations so so in practice of course you you can do we we need to do the cross validations to to really see that we are not just estimating or or or seeing noise but once you control for the uncertainty which in this case is key H you can get a very very good input from from your campaigns one of the main challenges that we encounter while working with Co models is model evaluation what are your main lessons from working with those models in practice all right so I guess there there are two components the first component would be about really the the Dack and and the Cal structure and the other about the estimation process so for the estimation we have many statistical techniques to to to evaluate that so let me focus on the on the Cal component and this is what I want to point out that I actually learned a lot of these reputations techniques from your book uh thinking for example what how stable is the estimate if you Shuffle the data remove some data or at a edge on our graph which shouldn't have any effect on on the estimation if you put the the arrows in the proper way so I think those are the ones that I kind of use the most for cases on like in marketing like media mix models where you have certain estimation of for example cost per conversion you can then um parallel run H some Geo test or uplift test to see in which extent this agree or not I mean if they don't agree that doesn't mean the model is wrong again these are all approximations it might just be hinting us where to dig deeper to have a better understanding of the process when you think about causal reasoning and uh causal thinking maybe in in even broader terms do you think that this is something that is only useful for for people working with modeling let's say the model part is will be about inference stimulation but the the Casual thinking about how our intuition can fool us is something that in my opinion um should be more spread across the industry so if you're are making any type of decision you you you are essentially thinking Cally so even if you don't work with a specific model but for example you're business analyst or marketing manager or someone trying to look into data and take decisions out of it and if at their disposal they have a dashboard let's say just by adding filters or filtering by variables which could be in this case colliders of your treatment or campaign you could be actually getting a contradictory result so what I'm trying to say is that having certain fundamental causality without going into the very kind of core H formalism is definitely something that decision makers should over all have because we can all be and I've been fooled by my intuition mhm speaking about human intuition I must ask you this question you're a father as well um sometimes we say that humans are very go good in causal reasoning as a parent uh did you have any experiences with your kids where you would see an Evidence or counter evidence for human capacity for Cal thinking I mean of course human learn very fast but I have a nice story about I mean we live in Berlin so my son he was born in November so when he was a year old like around 10 months it was already default in Berlin so we would go outside and we will I mean it was not that cold but it was when he was getting colder we will put him the gloves mhm and then maybe the first times he was actually not keen and actually he f a lot about putting him hit the gloves because he would associate that putting the gloves will implied that he was going to get cold and he didn't like that and of course it took just a couple of time and then he understood that the direction was in the reverse order so I do think humans can cause can think cauly but it's not on the first kind of iteration it's really about really learning and iterating but I think cality at least from what I've seen from my kids really comes from from experience and iteration and that's why kind of even as as grown up so to say I and and I've seen many people being fooled by their intuition because causality is definitely something not not trivial mhm so he was basically thinking that the causal direction is the other way he's putting on the gloves and then it becomes exactly exactly I would I would love it to be like this I would never put the gloves on I want to go back for a second to to your PhD and and geometrical analysis I remember that one day uh Michael brunstein who is one of the Godfathers of geometric de planning uh retweeted a tweet where another person a a a PhD a doctor a professor maybe I don't remember who that was um shared an email that he received from one of his students or followers and this person was asking him for a career advice so this person said hey I'm really interested in in Geometry I feel that this is something very fundamental very basic I'm super interested in this uh and I love the geometric deing and all of those parallels with physics and so on and so on but when I talk about this to my friends they tell me that I rather should do uh prompt engineering or do something with nerves of or other uh technologies that are very very hot now what would be your advice he asked and the person cited by by bonstein said that his opinion is completely the other that she could that that he should do something completely um re reverse so she he should go into geometric into study of geometry because as he said this is something fundamental and those hot Technologies and the way we in we operate with them like prompt engineering is something that will likely change with time while this basic fundamental uh techniques and the basic fundamental understanding working with those basic structures is something that we always have value what are your thoughts on this yeah I I I would agree with this kind of advice about really focusing on the fundamental and it doesn't need to be geometry but really on on the things that are the backbone of the theories so geometry could be one but I guess maybe more fundamental one which might have a wider application at least in for in the short term is for example linear algebra and probability theory if you have if you really understand these uh two fields and have intuition and of course in parall know how to do this with software you are halfway through coming back from that time when I was going from Academia to to the industry for me the biggest challenge was to understand kind of how this works in in practice the business problem of course certain techniques but learning the idea behind our linear regression or support Vector machine it was relatively natural thinking as as as linear algebra and and there are many examples for that because I guess nowadays linear regression is still a thing I would say that 80% of the problems at the industry can be solved with a good linear regression ER but there are other things that fade out so I don't know if you remember about Hadoop everyone was talking about Hadoop and I remember when I joined the field I was like okay I need to learn about a Hadoop my produce and then add this and Spark and now let's say I've actually never used Hadoop and and I have Pro proven and provided a lot of business values so but these things Fade Out so for this Hadoop example would be okay what you actually need learn it's about really system design and about how this a computer works and how this actually scales up and whether if you want to do it in Rust in Java in what in whatever language that's not the problem so so that's on the computer science side on the on the math side and statistic I would say linear algebra probability if you have that you're halfway through mhm if you if you could make a betat and what would be your your bet regarding causality is this something that will stay with us for a decade or longer or this is just a trend that we can see I mean I I really hope it's not a trend because this is one of the things that ER kind of it's It's fundamental for for Humanity in the sense it's really about decision making so it's really like a a framework to have a better decision- making process so I guess like the work that you're doing really democratizing this knowledge is something that we need to do more because what it would be problematic is that it's maybe a topic now but maybe people in the industry feel like it's too hard or maybe not worth the investment and it will just fade out so I I think we still need to work on on having more Cal education and kind of way of thinking in the industry I hope that's and I'm optimistic about that but kind of we need to make sure that we don't treat this as a hype or as a tool but really as a fundamental cop concept for better decision making what learning resources would you recommend to people who are just coming to causality they want to start learning about this start implementing in their work I guess there's there's no linear path and fortunately for us there are many good resources when I started it was a a little bit less well known or at least it was not clear for me so for example in my case I I came from a basan kind of framework so to say and and the way about uh this book statistical rethinking introduces cality within the basan framework and looking into probabilistic Data generation process and and Dax in the Cal sense seemed very natural for me that was a great entry point I guess the book by Pearl if you like the theory as well uh my advice would be that always kind of go with those type of of books and then try to do some coding on the side because they can feel a bit too abstract so definitely having some code around and and doing some stimulation is something that it's much appreciated because it kind of makes this intuition more tangible and I guess really about the fundamentals and if you want to have more survey like or going into specific software your book is a great resource of course and the book by Matos on Cal INF bra and the TR is also a great uh great introduction so I guess one of the things that all of these books have in common is that there's some code so that you actually generate some intuition with it because otherwise it's very easy to get lost in the details and that's why kind of in my opinion the way of really grasping these topics is through of course reading the literature but running some simulations and examples by yourself and also trying to see when the assumptions break right what let's say what I always try to do is okay there's a nice example in this book it works let's see how much do I need to distort the data or the assumptions to break it to get a feeling about how sensible it is because I have also designed or Tred to solve some problems that work for a specific case but then I'm overfitting the methodology to into the data and then I say okay the data is probably going to change what if we change the data bit will the method still work sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't so also so having the code Close to You ER helps you kind of do this scenario planning and and and changes in in the assumptions it's worth to keep a a childlike curiosity a little bit in the of course of course and of course this this is a key part and and really uh don't trust everything that you read so try to challenge that as well and yeah of course curiosity is the key component here what what would you what would be your advice to people who are just entering the field of machine learning maybe bean modeling or causality and they feel maybe a little bit overwhelmed or unsure if they can grasp all of those Concepts that are needed to make it something functional yeah actually that might I mean I I was there and that creates a lot of anxiety about what should I learn is it like deep learning should I learn already like tensorflow and Jacks and pytorch or but again I think it come back to fundamentals but also solving concrete problems and and by concrete problems I mean really business problems but if you don't have yet business experience and you're actually at University for example try to find a problem that you're interested in and trying to do some basic data analysis so something that is a in my experience when entering into the field in Colombia we had a referendum about a peace agreement that happened in 2016 if I remember correctly and the results were that they overall a little bit controversial but the no win where people vote against that and I was very curious about understanding kind of the geography and the distribution and the public data was displayed as a map and we have many districts let's say let's say States in in Colombia and I wanted to go at City level so what I I did is build my first scraper H with yeah beautiful soup nothing fancy and then build the scraper fight with the HTML there were certain cities where the page was broken so your if statement and so on and collect the data pass that into Panda data frame do some visualization and that's it there was nothing fancy and I think that's one of the big first blog post on my blog but then I learned so much about it really about what was the the core of it it was not really about kind of fancy machine learning but having some experience in doing that and it was a great learning experience so I guess of course there are courses there books but that Fades out relatively fast I would say going through the pain of solving a very concrete problem which interested you it it's a great way at least it worked for me mhm how did it work for you regarding your motivation when you finished this project I mean I felt like I could do it first of all so I didn't suck at programming and also it comes back to to to the to the kind of mindset that you you don't need to just see the the end goal but break out the problem into pieces and then solve one by one and then you can see the progress don't get overwhelmed to to what's next actually just embrace the the journey so to say and and at that time I was actually quite Keen in continuing because at that stage I was still not sure whether I want to do this or not at that time and maybe today I don't consider myself as a software developer so my coding skill is something that I've kind of gather with with time but it's really about curiosity and being open to learn new new stuff is there any question that you would like to ask me yeah I mean I guess I asked what's your motivation on democratizing cality because at least for me I mean I I learn something I use it in my work and from time to time provide a blog post which is not that maybe big as having a book or podcast or all of the things that you do H where do you find this motivation about really making this is more accessible to people that's a great question and you're not the first person who asks this that's some point in my life when I was in the very dark moment uh I was able to learn a lot thanks to people who just decided to share their knowledge their experience for free on the internet and I'm immensely grateful for this and I want to I don't feel like I have to but I really want to pay back to the community so that's the core motivation behind all of this I think that's fantastic because everyone at least I've gotten quite beneficial from have gotten quite a lot of benefit from that initiative and I actually the newsletter like it's it's a little bit of a pain because it's pile up all of the things that I need to keep reading but I find it quite quite nice great thank you I'm so happy you know this is the the greatest uh the greatest through out for me if somebody finds this interesting definitely absolutely I mean you can find the book in my library already I don't know I think of course family and and my parents and my my wife I mean they're always been very very supportive when I when I started I started studying physics in Colombia unfortunately we have a mindset on which kind of someone who studies physics or natural science is is Doom in a bad sense to become a a Prof a professor at high school but my parents were like very supportive like no it's it's really about what you want and then they also open their mind and for example they support me to to embrace those studies and not become another engineer I have nothing against engineer but I was just didn't want to do it and and also the fact that that they were support me mostly kind of really emotionally to to embrace this this this uh opportunity in Berlin to pursue my studies in in math and for them it was not easy because of course I'm not in in Colombia with them but they saw this actually it was better for my future and I've always found support from their side and now with my wife she's also a PhD graduate we had to to to be together let's say to to to survive together to the time and of course to her I owe yeah everything I've done in Berlin was there any particular thing that your parents did that made you feel really supported by that being there you know like it's it's it's not really about kind of money or actions but the fact that if if you know they're there you just feel this H support to to to keep going and you know that if you fail hard no matter how they're always going to be there to help you stand up and keep going that's beautiful I'm very fortunately so to say I feel very very lucky that's really beautiful Hanan that was a pleasure where can people find more about you or connect with you uh where where they can find your blog how they can reach out to you I guess you can uh look me for me in LinkedIn also in my blog probably you'll share that and I easily to find there are not many one or those working in Cal inference and vision method H but you can always drop me an email I have people have reached me through emails and sometimes my time is limited but whatever I have time to support we can bounce ideas and yeah and just talk about interesting topics we'll put the link to your blog and your web page all right in the show notes thanks thank you so much I really appreciate your time thank you it was a beautiful conversation thank you for for coming on anytime you want to come to Berlin thank you for staying with us till the end and see you in the next episode of the caal bandits podcast who should we interview next let us know in the comments below or email us at hello caop python.
