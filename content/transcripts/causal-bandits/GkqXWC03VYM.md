we had the incentive to misreport risk misreport by using historical data many people knew this historical data was not representative but was aligned with their incentives at the time to take more risk and to make more money to take bigger bonuses and next year who cares are markets efficient ah hey causal Bandits welcome to the causal Bandits podcast the best podcast on causality and machine learning on the internet this week we're going back to London to meet our guest he decided to do a p HD in super String Theory but he quit to pursue a career in finance he loves to cook and cycle an author entrepreneur and investor ladies and Gentlemen please welcome Mr Alexander Den let me pass it to your host Alex M ladies and Gentlemen please welcome Mr Alexander Den Al Alex nice to to be here thank you for having me today great thank you for having your time to to meet with us it's a pleasure it's a pleasure for me as well how was the experience for you going from a PhD program in an advanced field like super String Theory to the world of Finance I would say you know when you study Physics you you you you learn to be practical you of course there is a lot of maths a lot of Statistics there is a lot of experimentation in the laboratory so you learn to look for connections between mats and and the real world so this is the definition physics at least my opinion and not just my opinion but you know super String Theory went way too far away from that kind of direction we can't say that super String Theory it's something experimental so according to mist it kind of betrayed the the spirit of physics but you know I've been raised with this this this perod that you know the physical laws you can experiment you can Implement them you can build engineering applications around those and somehow super String Theory pushed the boundaries way too far and it took me more than one year to really realize you know after working on pure uh proven abstract mathematical concept that you know I needed to return to something that you know I I can see I can feel I can understand I can relate to and I seen in the in the real world so uh I had my baggage of mathematics sta ICS and the time you know there was a big wave of people like me go going to finance and it was a pure chance I was speaking to to one of my friends and he said why why don't you come to help us he was running this financial micro Credit Company and you know I was amazed to hear that something that's like finance that I had considered to be quite boring and also very political could benefit from from mathematics and and statistics so I I joined his startup uh back at the beginning of this century and I saw there is a lot of connections that could be made between uh physics and what was required by Finance so at the time we needed to calculate risk based on patterns in in Behavior so there is was Data we're starting to see a lot of data being archived and you know a lot of storage started to be available so we could do experimentation in in analysis this data yes it was a jump but without losing all my background and preparations and ear spent to work uh with statistic and Mathematics so I built on that yes was a slight change of Direction but it's a direction that besides uh benefiting from from my previous education was something that was growing actually could feel a lot of talent was was going to finance a lot of people like me wanted to something uh different with with very similar motivations uh but you felt the growth something we couldn't feel in physics for for a long time speaking about theoretical physics if you think about about the greatest breakthroughs in this really marvelous field that they happened in in the 70s and what came after is just a follow-up experimentation to prove results that can be that had been theorized back 50 60 years ago so there was this kind of feeling of stagnation in the community a lot of people people leaving the Academia disappointed but by this stagnation but you know this how things are you cannot Mo move the world as the speed you want you know people need to really to take a break make breakthroughs in other fs and and continue F I like physics I riding away already so I could feel the the growth and the utility of my choice again without losing sight of what I had done before in my University degree which mathematical tools or concepts did you find the most useful when you started your career in finance yeah uh Finance is is is quite Broad and uh use many different tools but of course you must have like the basic of statistics and and probability right uh stochastic processes uh was the baggage people who worked in finances and so-called quants uh so stochastic process stochastic differential equations equations were were must and they had been quite well covered in in my physics programs and of course when you work in laboratory in physics you you have to to build build some patter recognition too so the early seeds and you know of machine learning that you have observations you had to make sense and decision based on on those observations and you know this this resonates also in finance so statistical classification modeles or regression models especially when it comes to building credit applications that that there were a must so found this really kind of natural you know transitioning from from from from physics and using the same tools to apply in finance but at the time it the main to when it comes to markets and derivatives derivative pricing was the big thing at the time was a stochastic process stochastic differential equations that uh came easy to me after my degree in physics stochastic differential equations are also um a fundamental Concept in a new sort of framework caal framework proposed by a team led by Bernard shilov yeah that generalizes in a sense peran framework you started with causality very early yeah uh compared to compared to many people who are who are today in the field how did this uh all of this has started for you yeah one of the things I realized and other people before you know me had realized a long time that you know in experimental Sciences like like physics you you can have a control environment so you can conduct an experiment by trying to to insulate from all external factors and you can repeat repeat this experiment many times and you can draw statistical conclusions about the robustness of the law that you're trying to prove in the laboratory but economics is is is quite messy when it comes to this it's not falsifiable so we cannot like switch experiments back and back again sometimes you have one observations and the environment is not controlled so you cannot do you know laboratory your experiment you know uh do your measures without external infl there always something going on and a lot of exogenous factors and you have ever change Always Chang in context so you don't have fixed laboratory setting you have a dynamic environment that changes all the time so think at a time you know uh the concept of statistical repeti ility could not really apply because you cannot fix the environment so already starting to realize but you know it's not a big big Revelation that giving here but it was just my journey of maturation I really understood now what what people mean by that you know that economic Financial theories are not not FAL falsifiable but it translates into the fact that you cannot have statistical repetitions many time so you cannot infer statistically a robust conclusion and uh I did my degrees in Oxford my my secondary and Masters in mathematical finance and during that degree we started discussing you know it was during the financial crisis was back in 2008 uh that you know something went went wrong and the question what was what was wrong not that that was the big question and previous uh theories of financial measurement they relied on this concept of statistical reputability the things are almost stationary so you can extract stable statistical buttons so they assumed a a stable data generating process without interventions in a sense that's correct that correct and that Prov to be wrong that you know if you think of the most cherished measure in in in finance how to measure your risk is valuate risk you know you construct uh a statistical distribution of how your portfolio moves you have different assets can be equities can be Commodities uh can be can be bonds and having a stable distribution you can measure different percentiles of the distribution and you say you know the extreme one percentile it's a risk that I cannot tolerate so I have must have enough Capital to withand this kind kind of events but this 1 perti it's derived from a distribution that's assumed to be stable what happens if all of a sudden distribution changes shape and and we saw it happening during the the financial crisis what was supposed to be like Sigma event you know so very rare events happening one in 100 of years things like that started happening very very often so on on a on a daily basis and a lot of financial institutions when busted is a is a consequence so something was wrong with with the way we measured risk if people knew that you know speaking also to practitioners without any mathematical deep mathematical background they understood that you know we know that far has limitations but this what suits us now you know show showing lower risk is this these are the incentive in in in the incentives in the system so we had the incentive to misreport risk misreport by using historical data many people knew this historical data was not representative but kind of was aligned with their incentives at the time to take more risk and to make more money to take bigger bonuses and next year who cares you know this were the incentives and there was kind of Awakening that you know especially by Regulators that something different need needed to be done so I started think with with my supervisor Ricardo rebonato at Oxford he was at the time Global head of Market risk of the Royal Bank of Scotland but he also was a professor at Oxford University and having published already many many different books in paper so quite quite non figurant you know we we started talking with him what we could do differently and and he had this idea so they really did not originate from me that why don't we create forward-looking distribution okay not like taking stable historical data generating process but let's try to think what's going to to be the distribution uh forward in time okay and how we can construct that of course what is a distribution it you know you have a model of the world uh with uncertainty so we in a stochastic setting that is going to embrace how things can evolve and you might attempt to have also measurable quantities you know around this distribution what's going to be the level of your risk okay and the idea there was of course you know historical distributions they happened so you know them with 100% accuracy but we're thinking is it better uh uh to be approximately right or precisely wrong because if you use historical distribution you can cut really your percent out the distribution you want to be precisely wrong because it's unlikely sometimes of the future is going to be the repetition of the past on the other hand if you try to build future distribution you know there is some degree of approximation subjectivity so you're approximately right so if there is incentive to be approximately right right rather than precisely wrong what are the best tools out out there really to to to make make this go so if you look at Finance there are a lot of events you know it's Financial economic systems geopolitical they reaching events some of them are not predictable they're exogenous can be meteorological events for example you know all of a sudden they can happen geopolitical events and you know we've been living for the last two years in a a largely geopolitical world we seeing a lot of conflicts around the woods that were not predictable before to you know unless you're part of some secret service but even they most probably were misled so the question is how you make a model of of reality like that of course there are the so-called black swans you know that you can't really predicting they happen so if there is some if a meteorite falls on Earth you know it's very hard to predict a black SW it happens all of a sudden it's going to shake everything not just the the financial system but there are other events that we we we call Grace SWS that you know that they're going to happen you know this can be uh political elections for example can be referendum the the brexit referendum so so we live in information Rich world uh so there already a lot of ear warning indicators of what might might happen you know apart from this you know pencil already in the calendar events like like elections you can really thanks to machine learning uh sweep through the world and understand if they early warning indicator or something happening but once you have Clarity that something might happen so what do you do okay so there will be elections in in the US for example next year okay so it's very difficult to predict uh elections especially in the United States uh because the electoral system is it's very sensitive to two variations but you already know that it's going to be one of the two you can assign the probability to this H you can use numer numerous polls and simulations so you have kind of information you can also use information from the markets okay so the question is let's reason in terms of causality so this is where causality comes into the play we know that even in finest certain relationships are not symmetric symmetric so if if you want to measure your risk with the value with Valu risk measure so you need a correlation Matrix so you assume that things are associated but I can give some examples of why things are not necessarily associated in finance so if there is let's say crash of the S&P 500s implied volatilities will Spike up okay but if implied volatilities has spiked up not necessarily there has been a crash in in financial markets this spike in implied volatilities might have been caused by somebody else so you already see that we're reasoning in in directional mechanisms okay we know that water causes mud but mud does not cause water so you have in nature you have asymmetric relationship but also in financial markets and also in geopolitic in geopolitics things unfold there is an event which can be the cause and there's some consequences okay so if we speak about this example of political elections you know we can assign a probability based on quantitative measures like like Po spose it's not perfect you know sometimes uh posters that they get wrong but we can assign some already or some have a gut feeling it you know not feeling but substantiate with some some some measure what are going to be the events and what's is going to be the impact let's say for your bond portfolio or stock portfolio in case one of the candidates wins okay and they have their different agendas one of them can promise tax cut the other can promise more aid for for for Ukraine so more weight on on already on the federal budget so they're already giving you signals of what they might do okay so in the case they get elected what are going to be the the consequences and according to to this consequence you can ramify and you can think of consequences of consequence but when you do that you reason in probabilistic terms you never say this is going to happen it's not a kind of 100% probable chain of events so we're not in the interpretation of David hum you know of causality necessary conjunction we are more in the probabilistic setting of of of Jud so what you're saying is that we have we have some structural information regarding the directional influence of the events but the influence is is probabilistic so there are some probabilistic functions that they are not necessarily deterministic relationships between between different nodes in the network so to say that's correct that's correct so and you have enough information to assign this probability okay and and why do we why do we talk in in the terms of of probability because we don't have a rich enough description of the system and probability captures our our uncertainty about certain details of the system is that the reason that's the reason essentially background causes that you cannot Motel you know for example barometer rain you know it according to the pressure you can make an estimate you know whether it's going to rain but it's not like 100% prediction you know you can predict the WEA weather you know few hours before with a great accuracy but you know it's not 100% because there are other external uh causes there so they determine this this level of uncertainty that you know certain event can cause other events to happen but not with 100% certainty so yes it's it's it's an let's say the level of UNC in the system and it makes also economies that they reason already in terms of probabilities and uncertainty you know there are very few bold economists who who who reason like straight you know this going to happen 100% so they already risen in terms of scenarios and then competing narratives this could happen but 50/50 is going this one this other thing is going to happen so the question is how to encode already this existing thinking into a mathematical framework where we reason in terms of causes and effects rather than associations okay and you've been in this this this field for a long time so you know that these these tools uh coone networks or Basin networks they they have some uh nice properties so since we speak about probability and speaking about conditional probabilities this event will happen we generate with certain probability this other event and so on uh there's this nice object called Joint probability that you can derive uh from this from this uh Basin Network and essentially once you have this joint probability that's now forward looking because you made consistent mathematically certain events with their probabilities you can do whatever you want you can calculate the percentage of this distribution so you can have a forward looking uh valid risk yeah and if you think uh correlations are what makes up things in F but you know correlation between stock and bonds you know uh usually the convention of wisdom is that they HED Each Other Well in times of Crisis but very much depends on the crisis sometime during 2007 2008 you know all the assets went down together so this had never been observed you know our stock and bonds and now in in you know in terms of high inflation neither stocks or bonds are good for for your portfolio in the short term they all get get H so they're not a natural hedge so if you want to hedge your your your you know stock port portfolio I would advise for you to buy bonds maybe for the next few months but then depends on how many other factors and and so so you you know every crisis is different so having backwards historical distribution doesn't make sense so how to be forward looking in coo and derive a joint a future joint probability you know that you can use and you can query you know and this one of the one of statements of John Mayor can kanes that uh I really like that you know the world is uncertain uh but we as humans cannot do without attaching probability since even they're not exact you know having a imprecise figure is better than having no idea of what's going on joh man Ken also said famously that when the facts change I change my I change my mind how about you um when we when we built machine learning blackbox machine Learning System so associative systems and those systems fail it might be very difficult for us to learn something about what we've done what we've done wrong yeah because the entire structure is modeled u in a in in in a sense that is hidden from us yeah in a way that is hidden from us with causal model uh we need to make hypothesis and you said we might be approximately approximately right right because our structure the structure that we propose for a given problem is our hypothesis about how the world works so there's a risk in in explicitly defining our hypothesis because we might be wrong but there's also a benefit because if something goes wrong we were explicit about our hypothesis and so we can correct it explicitly as well that's true so one of the uh uh the advantages is transparency mhm auditability language of communication so with uh graphical models caal model uh the stru can become more more more transparent so you see what causes want and this also Fosters discussion it's not some Quant who calibrated the machine learn model in a lab you know you can expose your model even to to the Senior Management they can understand you're thinking and know and they can have other input that you know you can create a brainstorming uh uh brain brainstorming group so you yeah being able to understand this kind of models is is key and even it you know something else happens not exactly what you hypothesize but the fact that you had a discussion so you had a social model that's a social model so this makes you prepared so as I like citation and another great General General Eisenhower said all plans in battles in battle turn to be useless but preparation will prove to be indispensable okay all plant are useless in battle but the fact that you prepared with different scenarios and plans that that that's indispensable for for for you to do so having this this uh communication internally in an institution it's it's very important to foster a a healthy disc discussion now all these things I'm you know I'm saying and be working on them them for a long time and publish already two two books on the subject you know mind sound obvious you know you present something transparent forward looking C and so on something also that can be populated with a lot of information because we now we live in Information Age you have information from everywhere you have minutes from board meetings you have satellite images you have new scrape data so you have information to to build to the best extent possible uh Cal models uh but uh this object to my regret actually have failed to take over in in finance and in economics and uh it has been quite uh disappointing that there reasons for that for which this this actually happened what is your diagnosis what do you think are the main reasons why yeah the financial institutions and and people in finance did not start using them more extensively again as as I said before in financing economic and people who work within those fields that they they have incentives okay and they act according to to their incentives so think about you know how let's say stress testing is is done in Banks so it's a regulatory requirement after the financial crisis you have by anual anual depending on the geography stress testing where you have to perform a resilience test on your organization you know this this model you know you can play different scenarios test your portfolio according to these forward looking uh uh scenarios but the many factors that are dragging this back this kind of approach one is you know if you look at econometrics that it still dominates of course economics you know it's it's it's a very respectable science a lot of progress in especially 50s 6070s a lot of useful concept but again uh you rely on historical data there and you know the people who have worked for so many years are are in that field are reluctant to change your mind to something new said there is always resistance when you try to do something new of course there is the old school that that's trying not to to make you change anything for for for they're doing and a lot of Nobel prices have being given you know to be dissipated like that you know with saying that you know you have to change your point of view uh second is the uh resistance within institutions uh to do these things and you know they invested in methodologies and training in software systems that do the things s way so why change which requires an investment uh the the stimulus to change would be if Regulators ask them to change but also in the wake of financial crisis you know Regulators try to do something uh quick and dirty with banks you know you do stress that tests you know we we we provide you with the scenarios which sometimes they're not even coherent they're sometimes contradictory in a high level macroeconomic string of number GDP 4 unemployment up all these things that they don't have any context or narrative explaining but they just give you string of numbers put them in your econometric models you know what is the outcome but it's not very very forward looking you kind of Replay history and uh one of the requirements you should use stress scenarios and some of them are past stress scenarios or replay the great financial crisis on your portfolios and look for the association with your asses but the great financial crisis not going to happen at least in the same form the world has changed since then so you cannot use data from from from that period so a lot of incentives been misaligned and when all these Frameworks you know backward looking frers been implemented we were already out of the financial crisis 2014 2015 so there was no incentive you know to really to innovate to change time unfortunately unfortunately and uh we've seen you know Banks continue to defa and you know not to the same extent as in great financial crisis but with silicon valy bank and Banks and not only banks also corporate so having forward looking stressed test is really necessary but you know U it hasn't happened at least in the way I I wished it to to happen in economics uh maybe particular in macroeconomics it might be challenging to actually decide about causal Direction between certain nodes that's right yeah um and this is an artifact of I think the scale that we are looking at events at right so maybe we have quarterly measure measurements of of of certain variables what are your thoughts on on on this and do you think that even having those variables those difficult variables uh where we cannot meaningfully decide on the on the caal direction um can we still apply causal modeling to systems with with such variables maybe model those as correl correlational um yeah relationships and all relationships that are clearer at at a given time scale as causal relationships can this be still beneficial just to make it clear to to my previous point about the scenarios m having some kind of sensitivity to to macroeconomic variables of your your portfolio your institution it's useful but as I said sometimes it's difficult speak about causality and if you think what caused the the the the great financial crisis was not for of GDP or unemployment it it was mismanagement it was leverage a lot of other variables that are not macroeconomic nature interconnectedness between institutions the the huge derivatives book that that were mispriced you know this not macro scenario you know so you shouldn't always reason when it comes to stress testing in terms of macroeconomic variables which are just Aggregates and usually uh you know these macroeconomic variables lag what what happens because you know the GDP of course it fell during the the great financial crisis but it follow all the wiing of exposures of the banks and defaults and so on so it's not the GDP for C on institution to default but you know this this huge leverage and that the default of Leman brothers and another B that caused you know the whole mess in the economy then GDP for and employment went up so um but in general if we speak strictly about the macroeconomic domain how we can input uh causality in in in the macroeconomic it's more difficult because you you as you said you deal with with uh Aggregates and the time scale is you know it's very low frequency and somehow you can have feedback loops between with economic variables one variable causing the other the other in in its turn causes the first to to go in C so they feed on each other so it's difficult to find pure established relationships between macroeconomic Aggregates you know they're very few and they don't work across all times across all geographies but one of the clear links and caal links is the relationship between oil prices and in inflation of course if o prices Spike this will call pricing of the assets because everything depends depends on o if Regulators or central banks the race interest rates we're expecting inflation to go to go down of course so there is a clear C relationship but again not for all economies certain Banks and certain countes are very bad managing inflation so there is no ceration between rates and inflation they're trying sometimes their best but sometimes there is reverse causality you know uh when inflation go goes up their race rates inflation go up the lower rates so they kind of following inflation than on him you know and uh um and this is also a very zoomed out picture right like a micro picture yes we cannot understand the intricacies of decision making on like institutional or individual level so we lose a a lot of detail zooming out that's true so we we we dud the micro causality which we are not I'm able to measure in something that aggregate uh less frequent and you can better describe it through Association so you you you sometimes you have to relinquish causality you know causality is very useful microeconomics when you consider exogenous events you know can be flat weather condition election war and so so can inject information externally exous but when it comes to measuring the equilibrium between relationship between macroeconomic variables sometimes Association can be more useful useful C and you have some times reverse causality you know you have by Direction so it's you have other model I spoke in in my my second book on probalistic graphical models that you know sometimes it's better to have a hybrid picture yes having causality where it's possible leaving associational measures where you can't have this clear Co you and the hybrid model so if you want to model things purely Association you have the so-called Mark of networks Mark of random fields and director graphical model so all of the same thing but they're very useful they've been used in physics extensively to to model crystals but when it comes to economic and finance you can model associational relationship between a network of Agents or network institutions so again a graphical model like C almost like Bas in networks they they have very nice properties and you know you're having to derve a joint probability distribution okay by accounting on about the different you know relationship in in the network because you can have screening properties so you derive The Joint prop in the same way in a coal model you have cause and effect that screen each other you know if you think about chain event you know you have screening properties also in undirected graphical models you have spatial screening between different objects like we seen in in in a latis in in physics you know if different institutions are connected to that relationship they're not one institution is not connected through all the others you know have intermediates yeah you know so you see a network that you have nice screening properties so you can talk about some types of separation as we have thear in cality in spatial separation that's correct and you have uh in the end the hybrid model which is which can contain directed relationships so we can think in terms of kosal but also in terms of spatial separation so you can mix the two concepts you know temporal causality but also spatial separation and these are called chain graphs and chain graphs have not been explored extensively there are some examples in successes in genetics to to my uh knowledge uh I put in the book some examples of that but uh imagine that you have this big network of nodes institutions connected so you want to perturb the network so you want to you know you have some intervention yeah so how is going to to propagate across the rest of the network so this is where this hybrid networks they can help you so modeling interventions CA on interventions in into big interconnected uh systems but again applications have have been very few you know so when I published my book back in 2015 almost 10 years ago it was uh still very early days and you know I collected a lot of research at other people also had done there but and try to give a coherent picture at that point of Time how it could use those objects now things you know thank God I I I see things evolving and C AI reasoning in terms of graphically you have graphical networks it's coming back to the four something that I see quite with pleasure that it's going on but again there it's a lot work to be done in that space Finance is not only macroeconomics in one of the books uh that I'm reading recently a one that you recommended to we have it here actually about Simmons I think it's fair to say that he's one of the most successful investors in the in the history we can read about him applying maybe we should even say pioneering the application of mathematical methods um to to the field of investing and so in the book we can see that his hedge funds Renaissance and a couple of other Financial endeavors that that he was engag engaged in before Renaissance were pretty successful using what we could say associational or correlational models but each of those uh successes was also a failure later on at some stage so those models brought him a lot of money but also a lot of a lot of losses um investment in itself is a decision-making problem so we would we want to understand what will be what will be the outcome if we if we will do something we are not only interested in predicting something but rather predicting an outcome and maybe comparing it to to another potential potential outcome do you find the usage of graphical models and causal models in particular useful in the case of building investment strategies yeah definitely still there is a lot to be explored here as we discussed previously once you are confident about a closer relationship for example you build a scenario and once you have built a joint probability distribution so the forward looking data generating process you can do whatever you want So if you think of the marov uh investment thesis and how you know minimizes Risk by maximizing returns by building efficient frontiers of different outcomes you know it's it's based on historical distribution but the concept behind it states states it's about diversification MH okay and once you have the variance of your assets and the correlation you can maximize returns for given level of risks so that stays you know that that's that's the that's the the main building block of you know the motor investment world but things can be improved but by instead of using historical distribution historical correlation in variances variances use the forward looking distribution based on on causality so you can derive the forward-looking correlation Matrix but which is not purely association association is derived from coal consideration and once you have that you you can plug it in your optimization engine and for different level of of risk build you the maximize the maximum possible returns okay so in this sense you're again you're dealing with the concept of efficient Frontier so you can build forward looking Cal efficient Frontier so definitely this can change the the world of investing provided that you able to to to to to to make use of this approach you know all the framework behind building uh these different scenarios and now this is one thing when doing scenario based investment and it's it's it's a big thing you know you want to to know what how you want to invest your money in case one of the candidates in in in in the US uh wins the other approach could be not event driven but you want to build let's say your your C of Cal model of the of the economy okay uh which means that you know you have to predict different mcro Financial variables okay and make an investment decision B based on those you know how much rates are going to rise how much an employment is going to move and so on but this bows down back to the problems that we mentioned if you want to be the purely macroeconomic and financial model of reality you encounter problems like the lack of direction for example sometimes the fact that these are aggregated measures so you cannot have a clear view on causality so from that point of view if you try to build a structural coal model of the economy it's still a research problem a big research problem unlike you know exogal shocks like scenarios on folding and different consequences coming from from that primary cause the root node of the scenario so yeah these are two different approaches if you're micro event driven investor uh of course you should you should play with the scenarios be your forward looking efficient Frontier so if you want to do a lot of statistical uh trading high frequency trading yeah it's better of course if you build your Co Moto but you encountered the problems that I mentioned before it's a holy grave essentially to build a fully C structure model the the economy that's dynamic in in up to dat and it's adaptive this is the biggest challenge as of today in causality uh in general whilst in in stable environments you can confident that you can fer a cal model from the data and there are lot of automatic training algorithms PC MP and so on and you can be confident that since you're modeling stable distribution you can infer this this Cal mechanisms in in in a quite stable way in microeconomics it's it's a very dynamic system with a lot of feedback back Loops data generating process that you know it's continuously changing in in time so having that that approach it's more difficult and you know we we're seeing now Co I coming to the for and you know almost in every conferences a conference on AI there is still work to be done okay and especially one when it comes to economics and finance un like more stable environment which have their challenges of of course think about genetics and you have so many Gene expressions and so so many unobserved factors you know you have this but luckily that the distribution is stable unlike in economics sometimes you don't have to deal with this big amount of data you know sometimes everything BS down to few factors but inferring them in a damic environment that that's a tricky bit it's it's it's I think we will see some nice developments in exate on that front it sounds to me that the dynamic structure is is one challenge here yeah but another challenge is also the measurement what actually we are able to to measure and with what frequency so in this sense it's also a data problem it's also a data problem it's a DAT problem so a lot of variables that been latent you know now can be measured you know for example the propensity to consume of consumers in the economy okay it's been in economics uh for a long time but now we have the big data to be able to measure this you know there are lot of service on on your phone with thousands of users and this these things can be measured almost like in real time M you know so you don't have to to use Aggregates that are at a very low frequency and then as we said if you look at lower frequency sometimes you have to to return to the association of world because you cannot unfold all the micro Coos steps now I agree with you fully that you know there is a a lot of data more data compared to before which will help us to discover Some Coal micromechanism soci of the economy which can be profit be uh profitably Incorporated in that yeah I I believe the data will help of course uh and we stabilize things but again economies are you know time varying you know and there to to to a lot of external exogenous and predictable shocks mhm and you know also causality although you can measure some micro caal LS in in finance economics Behavior economics the question is how stable in time they are and we will continue seeing challenges there and uh we need an Adaptive coal system and you know and this is this is the the holy gra also of AI I think you know purely associational mechanisms and deep learning in language models then their associational associational models be built on stationary stable uh data you know but how to make that something that's adaptive and continuously learns and adapts the cing you know this is data will help but we'll see a lot of challenges also coming from from the methodological from how to deal with this data and do we have enough computational power uh to deal with this because you know learning in in in in Coal models it's especially they discrete model it's empty hard so it's extremely difficult to do this yeah and you know with few factors yes but if you have to deal with thousands of data sources and trying to discover different caal mechanisms between those since it's becoming also methological and computational problem but I'm confident we will see some some developments now with availability of more data computational power and awareness that you know if we're really to to be bu General um AI which is an Adaptive system that can be applied also to to economics a big brain that that learns these economic relationships and makes inferences and predictions you know there is awareness that you know if you want to build something that's TR Universal it's artificial intelligence we need to look in causality know not just associations in one of our previous uh episodes we had a conversation with naftal vineberg who was a philosoph of Science and he specialized in causality and and dynamical systems in particular and uh one of the ideas that he thinks is is a very important idea in causality that maybe we don't have that much awareness of this in the community is that causal models are scale specific so when we're talking now about dynamical structures in economics uh one of my thoughts was that perhaps those dynamical structures are almost are also scale specific which means that if we zoom in further down we could maybe understand the changes in the structure at the higher level of aggregation as a consequence of uh interactions on the lower level in in the more stable caal structure yeah definitely to to the point before now that we have more bread of data okay and we have more more high frequency data uh we can hope to to disentangle this micro coal structure you know uh which is wasted if you look at different time scale which is like the zoom out you miss the whole picture so no fully fully agree with the the this statement and but again easier said than done you know how how to methodologically to approach this you know how how uh forgetting about data collection avability problems that you have a lot them and also computations you know what is the amount of resources that you need to put in place you know it's even training a large language model it requires a lot of energy and computational resources to do something like that it's also adaptive I don't think it's going to be a less lesser effort in terms of computation uh but yeah definitely I'm very optimistic that that I think the right intuition but we need to prove it in practice now how to make work to make it work and you know that there's a lot of work going go the why that will make things happen are markets efficient ah it's been debated since the invention of the concept of of uh uh efficiency uh not sure I'm the most suitable person to to enter this this uh debate but there there's a lot of people making money out of inefficiencies in in in the market you know and uh it's a concept of the interception of Finance economics especially Behavior Finance economics you know is the price that you see in the market really reflective all the phenomena that you not counted into the pricing of assets or not so do all these agents thousands millions of them possess perfect information to come with a fair price depends there many formulations of the ficient markets hypothesis strong and weak and and so on uh it seems that to to a certain degree the markets are efficient but the strong efficiency is the dis is to to disprove and the think a lot of there's a lot of work to that revolved around that idea to disprove it and they manag to disprove it but uh are they reflective a 4way formation most probably not so not strongly efficient are they reflecting the best information possible most probably uh yes but then you have you know questions about the liquidity as well because if liquidity dries you cannot even get the right pricing because nobody's buying the the tring that does it so what I can say that uh markets are very uh you know if you take an economic model made by an economist and you're trying to predict something but if you take the market Market view on what that prediction might be can be I don't know future inflation from inflation swap markets and so on markets have proven to be more right than the average opinion of economy so there is a lot of information even there be some experiments is machine learning better predicting Market just doing all fundamental information like interest rates unemployment GDP and so on or if you take the the the what the market thinks and you know it's it seems that market is a better predictor than da machine learning so far mhm so I would say that they're not fully efficient but they have a good degree of efficiency in associative Financial culture would building a relevant causal model be a good way to exploit the inefficiencies in the market I mean uh building a CA mod it's always a plus you know even in the book of when he postulates what what the advantages of of a coal model it's it's one of the advantages is stability of relationships and you know associational relationships that they can break like there was an experiment to predict flu from Google searches on flu trend on flu you know do Google searches cause flu no definitely no that's not CA of relationship it's it's associational relationship but it it broke up it broke up it's been proven it broke up so having a caal mechanism to exploit any inefficiency it's going to you more stable results because going to be reflective of the mechanism that that generates this inefficiency so you're trying to understand why it happens you know so you you understand the try to understand the mechanism that it's more stable more robust more reliable in time then saying that something happens because another thing happens you know Association yeah for many people coming into complex Fields like causality machine learning or Finance um it might be overwhelming when when they realize how much they need to they need to learn in order to start be effective in those fields yeah what would be your advice to people that are just starting with something new something complex it's a very broad field so um there is no kind of recipe or or or a book that describes all all these things you know it's it it's AAR learning and you know I've been in causality for more more more than 15 years and still I'm far from fully grasping you know all the aspects of inent especially keeping up with with the latest evolution of this so there is no no text you know so of course important thing is especially when it comes to causality to understand what you're modeling you know uh I'm not Economist by by background but no yeah my my firm uh uh which I confounded with s the man a few few years ago predicts inflation in that micro variables and you know we have to know what we model so we're not Economist but I had to do a lot of work to understand uh uh the domain okay so which means that we don't just crunch numbers you know thousands of data Ser to PR the future we have to understand what is important okay and this BS to causality we we thinking although we don't have fully fledged caal model about this that it's still research in in in progress but uh at least help us understand what causes what yeah so although you don't use a fully fleshed causal model in terms of like a comp having a computational model yeah you are using a causal model of reality in order to design your system yes yes yes definitely so we don't crunch crunch all the variables in the world you know crunch around 6,000 uh uh time series but there are hundreds of millions of Time series they were there why did we select 6,000 out of billions of times years because this is a kind of prelection and it's based on on your Co understanding of the world it's you know the the level of the river tames here around the corner it's not going to increase in inflation although if you plot the two there can be quite strong correlation so we don't put variables in this pool that on prior grants can be completely related uh you know so there is always Cal thinking even if we we have now this big big correlation machine it's not fully correlation because a lot of thinking went into selecting the pool we we we put into and everything came from understanding B this to me so I had to write read a lot of books on inflation almost all of them available there so before approaching so it's you know understanding the domain it's really important uh about that so and since we dealing with with uh Big Data understanding of course data engineering of course you wrote a book on python this is a must this a must now and was surprised by switching from C C++ matlb to python you know it changes the world so having a baggage a good good kind of python trading helps a lot so understanding data understanding um programming languages understanding uh the domain that you're trying to model uh understanding also machine learning uh and it it's important there are lot of excellent machine learning books out there and we have some of them here can recommend the book of Marcus Lopez de PR if if you're started and uh he doesn't shy away from cold so you can see really cold there but you also have to leverage all the other text that are more like texts that are more traditional but it's the marriage between so uh and I I seen a mistake and you know you know I I I manage big teams in machine learning developers and Engineers sometimes people neglect the past and you know econometrics models they they they failed traditional Financial models and you know see many people that let's start from what might work let's start directly from from from machine learning and let's disregard all the stationarity tests in in col metric because the you know the neuron network is is going to learn by itself all thisly but that that doesn't work so always is you know build on the shoulders of giants who were before that so having kind of classical formation on depends on the field of Finance CH that derivative pricing it's it's micro markets micr structure or predictions or econometrics you always start from the pay so that you know you can't do at least in my view this kind of f lip it's kind of quantum Li you know it's without having a solid base so yes having a a knowledge of what's been done before it's extremely important we also be open to learn all the time I I'm still learning I hoped one they I'll stop learning but you know it's kind of trivial you know you have to always learn it's kind of LinkedIn post but it's really to if you want to be The Cutting Edge research you have to learn not just in depth and the world is complex so you have to to to stretch over several domains actually to to make things work and patience is one of the things that because it's so complex but you know you have tools like you know CH GPT now that can make your life easier when it comes to some summarizing writing codes so we're living on shoulders of giants but those giants can be also AI Giants yeah but it's a very exciting learning experience in finest for the last years for me at least yeah what is one or two books that Chang your life you know I've done many things in life from physics to to to to it studed economics then uh Finance so in each domain you know they they boosted you know that that they're there they're there to stay but of course the book of Jud PO is what is the one that opened my eyes and if you consider the first editions were were written a long time ago it's I think the first was in the 90s a second in the the big book cality The Big Book yeah the book of why I haven't already to to be honest with you but they say it's it's it's really not nicely written and you know brings this culture of asking the question why so this is this was the book that change change my thinking and also the book of Ricardo rebonato called coherent stress testing that uh is the first book that introduced cality U uh in finance um and yeah these are these are the books that changed Le my career for the for the last uh 15 years and of course when it comes to machine learning yeah I have did this one it's still here it's it's the book ofy tip shirani elements of statistical learning it's you know this where I learned first edition uh uh machine learning also the book of Kevin Murphy on on on machine machine learning and uh he he speaks also about um directed undirected graphical model so these are are the books that Chang my way of thinking and switching me for from thinking Association to asking questions like like why so it's not just you know it's a textbook mathematical textbook but changes your your your perspective of how how to think about how to think about events what keeps you what keeps you going curiosity maybe the sense of purpose that you know I want to do something uh uh different and you know life is short to live a mark on something that you know from from which many people can benefit you know and you know been many years you know in in in finance and that I work for main exception of bosses which I'm help so I'm asking the question so but what's your contribution maybe it's too early to speak about a legacy you know I consider myself still young but I'm thinking the you know the perspective that you know I have to do something it's maybe this is the right uh moment to live a marking how people think about cality at least in the financial and economics to me MH who would you like to thank to thank yeah I had many uh mentors in life and again in different aspects from culture to music to sports but being in the same domain my mentor been Ricardo rebonato an extremely talented and cultural person with a very sharp mind still sharper than me so I still look up up to him I also thankful to to Marcus Lopez the pra who actually gave gave me the idea to write the last book the book of alternative data and in finance I'm I'm grateful to to my supervisor Daniel Amit who unfortunately passed away some uh some years ago and but he he um he wrote a book on modeling brain functions so this were were like the first examples of newer networks but they were mimicking brain functions rather than having in engineering and you know this also made me think that you know there's lot of cross-pollination between Fields between physics in that in that example and how we understand um neuroactivity and pattern uh uh recognition yeah the these are the the people who who who have influenced my life and they still have impact on my way of thinking what question would you like to ask me Alex I really know what to say I'm really thankful first of all because you know you're doing something that uh nobody else is doing it's bringing this way of thinking to to The Wider community and being also active and promoting this and this podcast it's an example that I I I I think we we we will leave a mark but what's your motivation if I can reverse the question but what keeps you awake at night and why causality why this key word causality in your mind great question um so causality well I think at some point I understood that we are just not able to to answer certain questions using correlational correlational stuff and I was also struck by the clarity of of of Pearl's Theory so that was something that I I I thought remarkably interesting and I also felt like we as a community of people interested in in modeling creality in answering interesting questions so very broadly speaking that this is something we we could benefit from but there when I was starting with cality there was not much awareness about all this kind of thinking on this way of thinking the style of thinking about the world about modeling out there I I couldn't find information about this um when it comes to your first question uh why I do it and why I'm motivated there are many aspects to this one is my gratitude to to the open- source Community because I learned from this community a lot um the other one is that it took me a significant a significant effort to learn myself about causality and go from things like P causality book to code to understanding practical implication practical challenges of implementing this from computational point of view from implementation point of view and so on and so on um and so I realized that you know it was four or five years for me to have a good practical understanding how to do these things and I thought that I can help other people uh just take this journey and you know go from from the beginning to to a place where they can where they have good fundamentals and they can already do something in reality much faster MH than than it took me you know to do this to to build this skill set and you know it's also research about the libraries you know testing the libraries if they work actually because you know in open source is amazing but also doesn't count with any guarantees it's a jungo yeah definitely so yeah so these were these were some of my main motivations not all of them but some of them yeah yeah we're both on a mission it seems the cality mission mission yeah yeah I hope we can progress it you know the more awareness the better the bigger the community yeah and I think we can see that you know those ideas are getting more and more attaction um so so when I look at Nubs every year you know this year at newps there are so many excellent color papers I don't even know how many but it's I think it's dozens of papers yeah yeah and the number of Publications grows exponentially now if you look if you look at the history like since I don't know 2018 or 17 it's going exponentially up and you can see this also in the you can see this also in the software in the software space where you have we have just more and more like liaries caal libraries addressing particular causal problems right we have General libraries like d that we are talking about in this book or eonl but also people doing like fixed effects coal models you know specifically in Python and so on so this is really amazing to observe this is this Dynamics you know and how people are just opening themselves to this ideas and how it changes their modeling or general modeling culture to better because even if we don't Implement causal models literally like I know using duai or any other package the thinking about the that problems have structure and that this structure matters the structure matters I think this is something that already uh changes our modeling culture to better more efficient and yeah yeah yeah we asking the question why yeah that that's very important yeah okay yeah and we understand that this conditional Independence this conditional Independence um landscape that our models MH build depends on the features that we put there and if we put features that I know colliders or mediators that will affect how the joint probability is represented and will affect the generalizability of those models and so on and so on yeah so this is something really great to observe people realizing this these things and using their this in their work it really feels like you know we progress somewhere right it's yeah amazing journey yeah Alexander where can people find more about you and your work I think no I mainly my work is Publications uh you know it's on Amazon you can find my books so the first one on on K back written in 2011 published in 2014 then the second one on 2015 the most 15 the most recent one in uh 2020 and yeah it's I think it's it's Amazon and it's a good and yeah I've written some papers but uh usually my preference is for books right than papers I know people you know prefer writing a lot of papers uh I prefer to write books because I I like to to tell to tell the story so my you know my history is my books essentially it it depends um what kind of information but you know I'm I've created this firm uh that that you know faces Financial professionals and we're trying to predict inflation which has been one of the most relevant problems for the last two years so on the the website of the firm there there is more about what we do we're not fully coal but I said we have cality embedded in in in in our thinking so we're hoping to to Pro progress The Firm through the progress of also C influence in in in the the the community so yeah and where can people reach out to you personally personally it's uh uh on LinkedIn yeah I I I watch LinkedIn more than than my WhatsApp or Facebook whatever this the medium I use the most and yeah happy to to connect with everybody take questions discuss great amazing Alexander thank you so much for the conversation I'm confident that Community will love this thank you Alex been a pleasure thank you
