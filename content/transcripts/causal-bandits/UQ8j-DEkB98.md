I am a limited being operating at a particular time scale and I want to not have to know about everything happening in the universe to predict what will happen at this table to reconcile what feels to you like your own personal experience with whatever broader system makes the world hey causal Bandits welcome to the causal Bandits podcast the best podcast on causality and machine learning on the internet today we're coming back to Munich to meet our guest he has a truly unprecedented attention to detail growing up in the suburbs of New York he has lived in eight different cities around the world he developed a passion for studying the talmud and Sufi texts but he has chosen philosophy as his long-term partner it was his mom who persuaded him to create a Twitter account ladies and gentlemen Dr naali reinberger let me pass it to your host Alex mola ladies and Gentlemen please welcome naftali vineberg great thank you thank you for having me it's so great to be here how are you today aali I'm doing great yeah yeah I'm very excited for our conversation and uh really nice meeting you over 100 years ago an iconic British philosopher vant Russell said that causality is a relic of the bygone age what would be your comment on his argument so I have many comments on this uh I guess the first thing to say before diving into the details is it very clearly isn't so sop philosopher I'm a philosopher of science and there's often an undefended assumption that if causation is going to be somehow scientifically legitimate it must play a role in fundamental physics um and at the time of course Russell was thinking of a different type of physics he was thinking of gravitational astronomy quantum mechanics hadn't happened yet and what I want to say first is that well should we think about causation is that you know scientifically legitimate relevant look at any science look at epidemiology look at sociology look at industry see if they need to use causal knowledge uh and I would firmly argue they do so at least on the usefulness or whether it's a relic of a bygone age uh I think we can just very clearly answer right off the bat uh that it's not uh and that it is something of extreme usefulness uh and then we can have a further conversation of what is it uh and if you do in fact think that there's no causation in phys well then how is that compatible with higher level of causation and there's a lot one could talk about there but whatever we say there the legitimacy of causation uh the scientific legitimacy of causation is should not be in question one of the directions you focus in is looking at causation at different time scales MH can you share a little bit more with with the audience uh so I think in any science you consider this is not just about causation almost any claim you make or any particular phenomenon you decide to study time scale and scale more generally spao temporal scale it's going to be crucial so any physicist would know this it depends yeah whether you're looking at a system at the quantum scale or at higher scales where Newtonian physics is a better approximation uh right you're going to get different behaviors at different skills if you're a biologist whether you're doing cell biology or systems biology you're going to have different relationships so I think this is a very general feature of any scientific model and it's something that to my mind has not been systematically talked about in the causal context uh so this is something I've been working on uh very inspired by the work of Herbert Simon and in particular by a paper from 1994 by Yumi aisaki and Herbert Simon uh causality and model abstraction where they really give lots of the fundamentals on this but uh just to maybe give you you know just a quick idea about you know what I'm talking about I say time scale so uh so I remember as once at the the dentist uh and if we're were talking about flossing which I guess it's a normal thing to talk about with your dentist uh and he said that he always you know he tells people yeah well he ask people do they floss they say I don't floss because it makes my gums bleed uh and he says no your gums bleed because you don't floss uh now are they contradicting one another I think very clearly not if you haven't flossed and then one day you start flossing that day your gums are going to bleed if you floss every day for however long after a week your gums won't bleed so even with this simple everyday example when we talk about the relation between flossing and bleeding you get different relationships or different relationships because they're different scales depending on how you describe the system and that's the type of thing which I think is all over the place that when you're giving a causal representation a causal model making a causal claim it's going to be building in assumptions about what is the time scale at which you're considering the system in Industry um many people especially people who are starting with causality are very concerned about the possibility that they might be there might be hidden confounders in the system and they're probably roughly speaking two ways of thinking about those confounders so some people will just focus on variables that they might know based on their expert expertise in the field that they exist and they are hard to measure and and the second way of thinking would be about variables that are operating on like a large large time scales what are your thoughts about this so one thing I'd say is I'm not sure I accept either of those options uh so first of all I mean it is true that when you motivate a particular compounder you say well we um you know we're looking at the relationship between let's say you income and education and we think parental income is going to be a compounder and that's a way to motivate that you need to measure parental income but I think methodologically uh when we're thinking about a system and especially if it's a case where you don't know about it it's not there's a compounder that you add to your model if you think it's there I think rather if you give a causal model or any model and you do not include Compounders and you're trying to get causal knowledge you're in some way supposing that they're not there so it's actually a very strong assumption not to allow for the possibility of hidden Compounders uh and this is of course one reason why lots of people like experiments because at least with certain types of experiments you can by Design remove the influence of confounders um about the relation to time scale I think uh I think that's a very subtle issue that hasn't been fully studied um because it's not always clear that time scale is a problem here uh so people have theorized about causations so philosophers so an example of this would be Macky in cement of the universe but also people like Dan hman who is my grad school adviser so it's a commonly made claim which I think is right that whenever you make a causal claim it's relative to some concrete system so if I just start talking about some gas in a container that's governed by the ideal gas law which says that pressure times volume is proportional to temperature well I don't know what the causal relations are between those variables but now I tell you it's a movable piston it's in a heat bath that's maintained a constant temperature now I can add the causal story um and this could be true for lots of variables so even if you're doing epidemiology and you want to know the effect of watching violent television uh on behavior that could vary from society to society and it's going to depend how much television people watch and it's going to depend on a lot of things about how things are organized and often this is left in the background of any causal model where you don't you just give the variables and the variables are the things you're most interested in the v yeah the ones you want to know the relation between them and sometimes if you have some variable which is just very constant over time you wouldn't say that's a compounder because Compounders cause problems when they bury but sometimes if something's just fixed it just gets relegated to the background context so for example suppose you were doing a study of certain you know trading behavior and capitalist economies uh and over a few hundred years you have this country that's a capitalist country with a free market well they'll have one model for that and that's not a confounder I mean it is a cause in some sense it is influencing everything you consider but it's not a confounder because it's just in the background it just uh influencing every observation you make it's a precondition for a lot of what you want to say about how markets will react and how people will engage with one another in this economy uh but not a compounder so I think sometimes long-term factors are not necessarily a problem in terms of confounding uh they are important if you want to understand the conditions under which a model applies those background factors that uh could be constant over a long period of times it it sounds pretty much like as something that we could uh simply control with a with with an Intercept in the model yes just comparing the Baseline for different observations or different classes of observations yes MH yes and and when when those background variables uh can start being problematic so you mean background variables related to let so so so you you mentioned a couple of examples when we can think about uh those variables that are that we treat them as exogenous because on a shorter time scale as if I understood correctly on a shorter time scale we see them as constant yeah but on a longer time scale maybe there is some Dynamics to them that is just we just don't see it because in our data because because we are not observing them for long enough so yes and let me uh unpack the question a bit if that's okay because so we we were talking to each other beforehand and I want to make sure it's uh um clear to the audience what's going on so uh so yeah so I think a great example for exactly what you're talking about um and that just gets the central intuitions on the table is an example I took from a paper by Simon and wer from the' 60s uh so a very simple example has only three variables it's the amount of crops planted in a field the amount of crops that grow in that field and the amount of rainfall uh now rainfall is something known as an exogenous variable basically that means it does not depend on the values of the other variables in the model and any listeners who have done anything in Social Sciences know that the process of finding a truly or even approximately exogenous variable it's a nightmare you can always find something which seems like it doesn't depend on things but especially in Social systems people might respond to uh that particular variable but rainfall is a very good exogenous variable it's as good as an exogenous variable that you're going to find because the amount of crops that grow in a field depend on the amount of rain that falls and not vice versa right that seems pretty good now where time scale enters in here is if we don't just think about these as two events so if we don't just think about you know you have one year's rainfall and one year's crop growth but these is repeatedly measured variables uh so for those of you that know more this would be a vector variables or maybe a Time series well over a long enough time scale over 100 years over 200 years agriculture can influence climate so the amount of props who grow year after year presumably over a wide number of field fields that can influence future rainfall uh and if you were to look at the longtime scale model you would in fact have a feedback loop so the amount of crops you grow influences rainfall uh so to summarize what we have here we have some variable which we claimed was exogenous and everyone was really happy I assume uh and then I said well it's not truly exogenous it's in fact at a longer time scale there's a feedback loop and the amount of rainfall is changing but when I give you the original model and I say rainfall as exogenous I think most people are thinking at shorter time scales they're thinking well over the next 5 years even if there's some Epsilon some minuscule influence of crop growth on rainfall that's just negligible and even if there's some feedback loop that's negligible so we have these two representations one as a cycle one does doesn't both of them are appropriate at their time scales and it's not necessarily a problem provided that you apply the appropriate model at the appropriate time scale the issue arises when you extrapolate across time scales so if you were climate scientist and you wanted to study long-term effects of global warming well then you better not anymore AB using the model that says that crop growth has no effect because you want to consider longer time scales in makes a difference this reminds me of um of the ideas that are extensively discussed by by Ray doio his he's a famous investor and his Lively interest in history um so in his work uh what he did is he collected data from ancient China ancient Chinese Empires up to up to today for all major empires in the history and he looked at them uh looking for looking for for patterns um and abstracting maybe a little bit of why he did this and so on one interesting thing that he says is that in investment we are often limited to our lifetime of observations but this is just a this is just a very short sample very short sample when we look at the history globally do you think that those uh this kind of this kind of Cycles when you work with climate scientist or other scientists is it also relevant in other fields oh yes I mean I think uh it's a great example uh so I should look at it and uh but I think once you start looking at scale and trying to think about systematically you see it everywhere and I think what you're saying or yeah what you're reporting B doia is saying um this issue of I mean it's it's partly a costal question it's partly a data question it's whether you have the right amount of data to address the type of costal problem you want and finding a characteristic time scale so what's the right characteristic time scale for understanding historical events or understanding you know certain types of predictions or Investments I mean I really I started thinking about this as a very local costal problem well isn't it kind of interesting that maybe you can have different behaviors of different time scales I think that the notion of time scale and the idea you can have different patterns and behaviors of different time scale it's all over the place once you start looking for it uh so uh I think it's a fun thing to look for even if you don't care about causation but certainly if you do care about causation I think there's a huge amount of work to do there when we discuss those scales time scales and and different I don't know maybe spe special spatial scales and so on um it's hard not to think about about complex systems and the phenomena like emerging phenomena yeah um what are your thoughts about emergence and and causality so first of all I think that's totally right that yeah that yeah the broad project which I mean I'm focusing on time scale because that's the thing that I feel like I've have the most to say about but yeah the the big question here is is there causation in complex systems and there's lots of discussions both suggesting that maybe there can't be causation in complex systems uh as well as questions about you know yeah emergence and these types of issues I guess what I would say here is uh that if you accept my sort of thesis which Ian it's a hypothesis but that you know but I think I can give these clear examples that causal relationships are relative to a time scale um I think you're going to understand a lot of what people are talking about when they talk about emergence because part of the picture is that you're you consider a system at one say lower level of description and it looks like everything depends on everything else and you go there can't possibly be causation and then you look at it a different scale either lower or higher but let's say it's a higher level system and then patterns of regularity emerge they don't come from nowhere you can look at the Dynamics and dynamic systems theory is all about very broadly speaking how order emerges from chaos but the first point is just because you see a certain property at the you lower spao temporal scale does not mean that you won't have it at the higher one and going back to Russell I think this is another issue about physics versus other Sciences which is let's say Russell is right about physics whether what he says applies to other Sciences does not carry over partly for this reason now in terms of how it relates to emergence I mean this is going to be a very philosopher answer I think it really depends what you mean by emergence and lots of philosophers have racked their brains about how this could be possible uh where where does any of this come from The more I've looked at it the less I've worried about that uh and the reason is is that I think that the picture lots of philosophers use still often is very much in terms of levels so often it will be you know the lower level as parts of the higher level or there's some more complicated pictures where you can have orders of properties so you have an object that at one level of description is described at just a physical object at a higher level of description is described as a quk screw so something you know so you're giving a functional characterization and then there's all this discussion about what's the relationship between the levels but still understood where always quantifying over the same object so you can describe something as a cork grw or just you know in terms of some physical characterization presumably it's some sort of lever or something and uh you're sort of still you know even though you're changing levels you're not changing objects when you consider a system at different scales in some sense you're considering different objects so you're zooming in and zooming out is a way I like to think about it so to give an example uh suppose I have a room that's regulated by a thermostat and I turn on the oven and the oven makes it the case that 5 minutes later the room is a bit hotter and an hour later the room is not hotter because the whole point of a thermostat is to equilibrate the room to make sure the temperature does not change in response to turning on the oven now there's no contradiction between those models there's no arguably interesting metaphysical question or puzzle how turning on the oven can you know have this effect at you know one you know at one interval and not another so you don't get these puzzles that and there are lots of puzzles in the metaphysical and philosophical literature but at the same time when you go to even more complex systems uh so systems with various feedback loops and patterns of self-regulation and systems hooked into one another you do get these types of complexity that you wouldn't see just looking at a part of the system so at least to the extent that people talk about immersion is something something that's spooky or where did it come from uh my view is that you I don't get that effect when I look at these models because if you understand what's going on there's no contradiction or at least yeah no puzzle in the fact that you have different patterns of behavior at different scales uh maybe we could have lived in a different Universe where we didn't have that but we very clearly live in a universe that does yeah exhibit different patterns of behavior at different uh time and spatial spao temporal scales we started our conversation with berand Russell and his stance on causality and while replying to the question about your view on on his stance you mentioned the question of what what is what is causality actually how do you think about causality as a philosopher first of all when I think about causality and is there causality I don't think about like let me find a catalog of the universe and see like well where is the causal stuff or something like that um rather I really start methodologically so here I and everyone else or lots of other people are influenced by cart right her causal laws and effective strategies where the idea is is that we need causal knowledge because we want to be able to understand the difference between mere prediction and cases in which we actually want to intervene on a system so you don't just want to know that you know people that take the drug are more likely to recover you want to know that if you give people a drug they're more likely to recover and that's well at least that's a starting point for thinking about causality where you think about the methodology uh and there's a lot of methodology so as probably last of the listeners know there's now there are now many algorithms for uh discovering causal models where the foundation of a lot of this is thinking in terms of interventions now here I want to be a bit clear because I know that at at least uh at least on the philosopher side of this uh some people will hear the answer I just gave and it sounds kind of pragmatic it's related to practice and say well oh that's not an account of causality you know yeah that's not telling what causality is I want to push back a bit uh because I don't think it's the whole story um but I do think that there's you know when you study the methodology and when I study the methodology seriously you're not just doing mere methodology you're not just kind of studying human reasoning or capacities to the extent that causal methods work they work presumably because of features of the world and I think uh and this is something I've also argued for in a recent paper with Jim Woodward and Porter Williams uh that you can look at the causal methodology uh and think about what are the worldly assumptions that make these methods work so I do think that this is not just a epistemological or mely epistemological project but that by looking at causal methods we can learn about lot about you know the nature of causation and the nature of the world uh and that's certainly a project I think we should be engaging in do you feel that uh the progress in physics that that we observed for the last century or so um has influenced how people think about causality it did it devaluate in a sense Russell stance I think in at least one important sense Russell has been Vindicated uh which is that so he's writing in a times this is early 20th century and my understanding and here I'm just reporting what other people say is that when you look at you know 19th century textbooks the idea that there was causation in physics was not particularly controversial you know the idea that forces were like causes or that you know acceleration causes velocity caus position those were kind of part of you know at least how people would present the theory and I take it what someone like Russell and even earlier Ernst ma realized was that you actually didn't need that just to get the physical Theory to work and I think whatever else we've learned uh that seems right I mean you could argue and people do argue so Mattias frish has a book called causal reasoning in physics defending that causation has a role to play in physics but it's certainly something you need to argue for now in a way that you didn't have to before Russell uh so in that sense he's Vindicated even if the physics looks very different uh now as far as I could tell and I'm not I'm of course not a physicist or even a philosopher of physics it Still Remains very controversial whether there is causation in physics uh so sometimes physicists will talk about a principle of causality and they mean something like a locality principle and that to me looks very different than the causal relations in causal graphs uh so the types of methods I use so it you know it has the same name but whether it's telling you something about causality in the sense used in other Sciences I think is unclear uh so I think it's a fair question where this causation in physics often when people describe this they assume the question concerns whether's causation in fundamental physics because I think actually clearly in some areas of physics there is causal reasoning uh if you're building a large hrun collider you're going to be doing certain types of interventions on it um but yeah I think it's still an open question and I'm fine with that when answering the question about the the nature of causality and how you think about it you said that you don't see it as a merely epistemological project um and now where we talk about physics you give this examples of different of different levels do you have a feeling that there is a certain level at which talking about interventions as we do in the pean framework stops making sense in physics or more broadly in science I think it's a live possibility um I think it's unresolved so certainly in the physics context there's a fairly large literature on bells inequalities and epr experiments so sets of quantum mechanical setups and well-confirmed results where there's really good reason to at least doubt whether you can give the you know these types of scenarios and these phenomena a coherent causal interpretation so that would provide at least some some evidence that maybe at certain scales causation um breaks down and I think it's a live possibility I think I mean what I would say is first of all even if that turns out that doesn't threaten there being causation at other levels in a meaningful sense and I think we really reason more systematically and think about this scale relativity and how causal Rel relationships depend on scale before we can really figure out whether we know the answer to the question at some point of of your career you are also interested in in in cognitive science and the connection between the physical fundamental mental processes and perhaps some non-physical properties of those processes if there are such what are your thoughts about mental about the possibility that mental States can influence physical reality I guess it's clear enough that they can um the the question is then you so if I have a mental state I make a decision and then I do something and I move an object um I've changed it the question is always um well okay how do we understand the relationship between the mental and the physical and yeah it's uh this is something I've certainly haven't thought about in a lot of detail uh in a while it's another one of those areas where I've become a lot more pragmatic in a certain sense um so well in the following sense which is that so philos person is like talking about like levels and they talk as if there's like two levels like the mental and the physical and then it's like what's the relationship sometimes called the the cart's error right yeah and I mean first of all as you can already tell from our conversation I way prefer to talk in terms of scales I think that's more precise and more scientifically interesting and I think lots of times when you talk about different scales whether it's you know the scale of the table or molecules there might be 10 orders of magnitude between those and I think that matters that sort of all this armchair reasoning of you know the mental and the physical and there's some relation between them but we don't yeah we're going to talk about levels we don't know how many levels yeah I mean I'm I have less confidence than I used to they can say very general things without looking a bit at the details um so just to maybe fill in something a bit more concrete so um so I had a fun paper that I wrote with Colin Allen um having to do with certain debates on in cognitive science between various ideas of cognition roughly yeah is cognition like a computer like the traditional picture or is it like a dynamical system and one thing we did in that paper was looked at uh some of this excellent work by Randy beers lab in Indiana where they evolve these you know multiple neuron artificial organisms and evolve them over many generations to do certain tasks uh maybe to find food sources where all of this is you know again on a computer uh well or avoid you poison sources or catch an object or what it may be and then they do some analysis about what's going on in the neurons when these evolved organisms um you know do the task they've evolved to do you know we talked just about you know what does the representation look like should that better be understood using one one model or another are these different paradigms even in Conflict so the same way that you can consider a system at two scales it might be that thinking about a system computationally or dynamically those are just two ways of thinking about the same system and the point I just want to make for this question is these organisms these you know you know minimal cognitive agents as they call them I mean these yeah are so simple I mean these are not yeah there's no debate about whether these are conscious but we learned a lot just by thinking about them and modeling them and there's many stages between that type of task and the type of tasks that humans do you know even before you get to the higher tasks so I really I've become less focused on what's the relation between the mental and the physical and more thinking a little bit in this engineering way of let's think about different types of cognitive goals let's think about how the organisms do it and and in general I try to understand simple systems that have at least a little bit of complexity and try to understand those really well before moving on to you know something a bit sexier but that we um yeah we want to know the answer to but maybe we just don't even know the questions we're asking you mentioned uh taking those two perspectives a computational perspective and and a dynamical systems perspective and treating them as two different descriptions of of the same system do you think about as uh equally relevant descriptions as well uh yeah I don't see why they need to be in Conflict I mean so the the backstory here was that there was this long project in uh cognitive science you had gone back to you touring theories of computation where you we think of the brain as a computer that's the model you have and it's uh of course there's a whole theory of computation about how computers work and how you can divide a task up into subtasks and build these modules to where each module does a subtask uh and so on and so forth and the idea of the dynamical picture or at least the the picture of the dynamical picture is something like maybe that's not how the brain works maybe the brain or maybe cognition doesn't work by dividing something up into different tasks if you think just about you know what it takes for a human being to walk uh this not like you you know pause and you you know try to balance and then kind of move your leg and I mean everything's happening in real time and everything happening yeah everything's you need to be doing everything at once and you need to for everything you're doing you need to be have a system that's monitoring your position and your weight and your balance and uh and part of the motivation to the dynamical view was the fact that long after machines got really good at playing chess they were really bad at walking and the thought is maybe we have the wrong picture for what they're doing so that's why dynamical models were seen as really important and of course I I also like dynamical uh modeling tools for lots of problems it's just that the reason I don't think they're in conflict is that people sence talk about dynamical models as if they're not models as if you just describe the system you just write a bunch of differential equations but I think if you ever actually look at a set of differential equations uh and more importantly how they're applied to a concrete systems so not just in a textbook but you know how do you use them to model a pendulum or yeah or a neuron or whatever you're modeling and those are modeling assumptions like any other and I think those modeling assumptions are very similar to the type of assumptions that go into a causal model or any other type of model uh so it seems me totally plausibly that sometimes yeah when you're comparing dynamical models to more computational models it's not that one is just the pure description of the system and the other is some abstraction where you broken into Parts even the dynamical model works like that uh even that implicitly is uh choosing uh an interval at which you're considering the step sometimes uh you're making assumptions about boundary conditions initial conditions parameter values all of these build in a lot of assumptions that are not fundamentally different than another type of model when you talk about assumptions uh it it reminds me the conversation we had we had yesterday when we met and you told me about this idea that people while seeing a less complex description of a system yeah might automatically assume that there is less assumption oh yeah and that's um that's false so as we were talking about I think one of the key features of a causal model is that the assumptions in the causal model correspond to the arrows that are missing from the model so if you ever have two variables in a causal model and you don't have an arrow between them uh and you don't have a common cause that's a very strong assumption compared to if you just have an arrow and then maybe there's a causal relation or maybe not and yeah I think that's a very important point that really what makes causal models work or not work are these background assumptions and yeah it's of course hard to establish them which is I mean that's not the model's fault that's just how how the world is um I mean another uh famous cart rightism is no causes in no causes out you need to make causal assumptions but the hope is that by doing so you're able to take a complex world and render it simpler and render it more tractable so to make it into something which you're able to interact with in a localized way many people who are starting with causality uh have this very fundamental fear that if they build a dag a graph that represents the system they might be wrong what what would be your advice to them well first I would just say that if they don't build a graph they still might be wrong unfortunately um I want them to be right I'm rooting for them but um I think it's a legitimate fear I mean I think you know so so I'm a philosopher and I I mean I work a lot with scientists and I want my work to be relevant to scientists but my job is not to or I'm not qualified to tell scientists oh you absolutely have to use causal models I always need to make a conditional claim which is look maybe you just do prediction and if you just do prediction may maybe you don't need these models um but if you want to make causal claims if you want to model the effects of interventions um in some cases even to interpret certain types of data if you want to know which probabilistic relationships will or will not be invariant you do need more modeling assumptions and at least in the first two cases you need causal assumptions so I think what often happens is people reasonably say some something that you said well I'm just nervous cuz I might be wrong and it's totally consistent to say that and then just not make causal conclusions but I'm I worry that all too often what happens is people just don't use causal methods and still make causal conclusions so I think uh one of the Prime offenders here is uh uh psychology psychologists um I think that's an area where with uh with some exceptions so I've had some really good interactions with the you know University of Amsterdam people who have become way more sophistica causal methods but there's still kind of a reputation that's not unearned of well they go to school they're taught correlation does not imply causation and they get that drilled into them so you see the paper and in the method section of the paper not a word about causation maybe you do hypothesis testing and uh various other types of statistical methodology you turn to the discussion section uh and you'll see words like you know X promotes y well promote is a Cause claim so you know what I end up wanting to say is that if you're going to make causal you know if you're going to draw causal conclusions you need causal assumptions and there's nothing magical about causal models but they do allow you to make those assumptions more systematically and to spell out what assumptions you would need in order to get the conclusion you want and I see that as a huge amount of progress I also like to emphasize that if you build a model and this model is wrong you build this model explicitly and then you learn that the model was wrong it's a learning opportunity for you to modify the model make it better while if you just push it to your scientifical statistical subconscious um you just don't learn anything maybe you you just don't learn anything maybe you will just retrain the model right again and again yes yes 100% I think the the great thing about models is if it's a good model you learn something about being wrong and that's as much of a conclusion uh so uh yeah so I'm totally on board and I think it's true both for um both in science and in philosophy where there kind of uh cottage industry if for talking about non-causal types of relationships which in principle I'm you know on board with while you know there could be as many types of relationship in the world as there are I mean there's there's nothing nowh is it written there only have to be causal relationships but I think sometimes you to see if there are at least my strategy is build a causal model see if e a model of phenomenon uh that they claim needs this other type of relationship whether it's a mechanistic constitutive or non-causal relationship and I would claim that if I'm able to model it that puts some pressure on whether you actually need this other type of relationship and the point isn't that oh we need to be maximally parsimonious and yeah but just to really be clear about what we're doing and I think if nothing else causal models are very clear about what their assumptions are and that means we can figure out what happens when they break down and the more you use them the more of a sense you get regarding which assumptions are more just uh assumptions of convenience which ones are more fundamental I mean I think there's a lot more to think through there but uh but that the models really do come with rules and interpretation and uh they're developed for certain purposes and you can see what happens when they succeed or fail at those purposes in the parel framework we have this idea of Le of cation we have associations uh interventions and counterfactuals in 2018 we published an interesting paper about a different outcomes of interventions in dynamical systems depending if we just perform a point intervention just for like for a second or we hold this intervention constant for a longer period of time can you share a little bit more about this uh sure yeah so the paper was called intervening and letting go and my thinking about that was inspired by a fairly simple case so earlier in the interview I mentioned ideal gas system so you have you a gas in a container uh and you have thermodynamic variables um you know pressure volume and temperature uh so we can imagine the gas is immersed in a heat bath and uh governed by the ideal gas law so pressure times volume uh is proportional to temperature um and we know with this type of system that uh you can have different setups uh so once again I said yeah to go back to another thing from earlier uh in our conversation causal models are relative to a setup uh so if it's the case that you have a sealed container so fixed volume uh well now you're going to have one causal model uh so volume and temperature will be caused of pressure on the other hand let's say you have a movable piston uh well now it's the case that volume can change pressure is constant so pressure and temperature cause volume okay so far we're just talking about the equilibrium relationships in the system and there's just a little bit of a puzzle having to do with interventions even at this stage uh and the puzzle is as follows so say we start with the movable piston uh so again the one in which uh pressure and temperature cause volume and now you fix volume say you put a pin into the side of the Piston so now instead of the Piston moving it it's just fixed well now this system will behave like a sealed container and what's puzzling about this and without getting into the details is that so the whole point of an intervention uh and the whole ability of representing an intervention using something known as the due operator entails there's certain semantics for how the caal relationships and a system should change if you intervene on a variable now when you stick a pin into the side of the the container and fix the volume that looks like an intervention but you don't get the result that you would expect if it were an intervention controlled by the DU operator so that's the original puzzle uh I first discussed this in a paper with rubben Stern and Dan hman uh 2013 or something like that and there we just said well look there's just these two systems with different causal relations causal relations are relative to system and here's just something that illustrates that and that there's no single graphical representation of both now where things get perhaps a bit more interesting is that after doing this Clark lemore directed us to the work of Denver Dash um who uh graduate from pit in 2000 I think he now works for Microsoft but I'm not sure but anyway he uh wrote a dissertation in which he gave a similar type of case and also focused on the Dynamics of the system and if you give a dynamic represent presentation something in the style of iaki and Simon from the 1994 paper I mentioned earlier well you see a you know a different time scale representation so instead of just talking about the relationships at equilibrium uh you have a feedback loop so you can imagine that there would be periods of time in which the Piston would be away from equilibrium and there would be a feedback loop between pressure and volume as the Piston expands or contracts you know say in response to a change in temperature and now the question is what is the relationship between the dynamic and equilibrium models and I know there's a lot on the table here so um thanks for bearing with me now what Dash thought um skipping a lot of the details was that basically the dynamic model was a good model uh and that if you looked at the dynamic model it actually privileged one of the two equilibrium models so the the basic argument is something like well look at the sealed container model so the one in which volume and temperature cost pressure well that model perfectly well predicts the result of all interventions so that's a good causal model the movable piston model does not uh so get rid of it and in fact get rid of both because you don't know which one is the right one till you look at the dynamic model so would that mean that um one model is a special case of the other model well they qualitatively different so in the equilibrium models there's sort of no translatability that's the sort of worry I think there's something to that I mean in the sense that it's very worrisome when you have an equilibrium model and it there's certain interventions it doesn't predict um but I think what's very interesting here is exactly why the movable piston model does not predict the result of interventions and it has to do with the fact that we're thinking about interventions in a particular way uh so here's where time scale comes in again and here's where hopefully some of the pieces start to come together which is that so when you're considering a system at a longer time scale or when you're assuming that the system is had time to reach equilibrium you're not considering the system in time and when you're talking about an intervention so you say intervene in volume intervene in pressure you're talking about holding it fixed indefinitely for all time you might call it a clamp in mention now when you look at the dynamic model uh in the dynamic model you'll see a feedback loop a feedback loop that you know brings the Piston to its equilibrium volume now when you hold volume fixed you're basically not allowing that feedback loop to operate so the intervention destroys the system's ability to reach a certain type of equilibrium and the point of the paper is that this is a general feature of Cal models and that in some way there 's no or I would argue or I did argue that there's no basis for preferring one of the equilibrium models to the other it is true that only one of them can predict all the interventions but each model is true for a different equilibrium state of the system and in the same way that the movable piston model does not predict what happens when you insert the pin the sealed container model does not you have predicted am is when you remove the pin so letting go is when you remove a constraint on the system that need for it to be there to have those properties those two actions are separate putting the pen in pulling it out it happens to be that putting the pen in corresponds to the formal operation of an intervention while in equilibrium models there's no operation for pulling it out uh but this is a blind spot of the formalism the blind spot of the structural causal model formalism yeah yeah so the point of that paper is to at least defend the equilibrium models on their own terms um now I should should say so cuz again there's a whole lot on the table there and and really the point of that paper so I've been playing around with these Dynamic causal models for a long time and and it was really important for me to respond to dash because I saw and I should say you know his dissertation is great and it's really uh if anyone's reading my dissertation in 20 30 years then yeah whatever they want to say about right or wrong so uh really amazing work um but I really felt like in some ways people took as a result as a pessimistic result uh about you not using equilibrium models while I thought my paper had a more optimistic takeaway and for me it was important to make sure that these models worked uh and he was giving some reasons that at least some people take to undermine uh certain features of the models so in some ways that was a paper which I needed to do to make sure the details worked in terms of what to take away from this uh that's really what I've been working on now or one of the things I'm working on now uh so right now I have a very exciting collaboration with these two Miguel professors uh so the status Russell steel and the epidemiologist Ian shrier and really we're trying to kind of now that you know this sort of foundational or at least you know the kind of kicking the tires work has been worked out to really draw some broader lessons and you know the broader lessons for practicing scientists aren't you know about the epistemic validity of equilibrium models it's really about what do we learn about these types of systems and I think what you learn really is that when you start to introduce time into causal models it changes things in several important ways including uh how you think of interventions so when you think of a variable not just something you measure once or not something that's constant for all time or not something that's equilibrium but something you could repeatedly measure so you're measuring a person's temperature for many days or I mean really anything you measure repeatedly it doesn't matter what type of variable and then you talk about an intervention uh and now we can distinguish at the extremes between a clamp intervention something that holds it you in place for you all time or indefinitely a shock intervention something that just influences at one time step uh lots of things in between including repeated shocks um you know at different intervals and it's not that no one has made those distinctions before but uh I think these can really more systematically be incorporate into causal inference uh and I think you what we want to argue is you really need to do it to think about S as the outcome of interest uh so people in the potential outcomes literature are often focused on defining you know here's the variable you're targeting here's the outcome now if you think about what's going on uh when you're administering chemotherapy to a cancer patient um and this will be one of the many things I'm talking about where you know I'm doing this at a high level I don't I'm not yeah I don't know the underlying science but at least my general understanding what you're trying trying to do is before you do the chemotherapy the body is in a state where it is not able to eradicate the cancer what you want to do is to give enough chemotherapy so that the you know you've destroyed enough of the cancer so then the immune system can take over and what you're doing here is you're trying to change the whole state of the system and you're trying to influence the feedback loops of the system and you're trying to bring the system into a new equilibrium State uh so I think that's just one example where you're trying to change the stability properties of the system and that I think is kind of the the bigger picture here where in the intervening and letting go there's this very broad-stroke thing where it makes a big difference whether you sort of intervene and hold something fixed or you let go and you choose not to intervene on it but everything you're doing in the real world are interventions lasting for different durations and different amounts of time and on both the cause and effect side you care about these durations and about how long do you need to intervene how persistently and when do you expect the effect of Interest or what's the time scale at which you'll observe an effect one description of those systems that comes to mind is is by using differential equations on the other hand the the idea of intervention is very well defined as you mentioned in the pean framework is there any bridge that you see that we could build between those two uh different perspectives on these systems that could make it um easier for us to unify these perspectives and take what's best from both worlds sure so first of all I need to do a shout out here to the great work coming out of UR Mo lab um at the University of Amsterdam uh Conrad def Institute uh because they' really I mean before a few years ago there was almost no work on this and now there's a ton and it's almost entirely due to them and uh yeah so um youris as well as he recently had a gr student tenica Blum I mean there's a whole bunch of great people there and so there's now a lot of work being done there and I'm not going to go into detail about all of that but before I answer anything of this question it would be uh I'd be remiss if I did not kind of highlight uh that there's really exciting work being done there and anyone with interests in this should also look at what they're doing uh but uh very generally yes I see part of what I'm doing is trying to understand the relationship between these because uh I've mentioned few times in passing this work by uh I wasaki and Simon where these Dynamic causal models which basically what they do is they allow one to understand the relationship between causal representations at equilibrium and causal representations away from equilibrium so more dynamical representations and in one of my papers on near decomposability um in philosophy of science I explain I spell out the details of how this also relates to time scale issues so if you think about systems as having a long run equilibrium or tending towards a long run equilibrium and Dynamics as perturbations from that equilibrium you can use this framework that was developed for equilibrium and away from equilibrium to also understand the relationship between causal relations at different time scales but to get to your question so what's one of the interesting things about the dynamic models is that they do involve things like time derivatives um and other you things like uh integr the operation of integration uh which is operation applied in dynamical system yeah just the inverse so integration is the inverse of differentiation and you have these operations that appear in you know just standard calculus or in dynamical models and they're now appearing in caal models and what I take this to show is that at least when you're able to write differential equations in the canonical way specified by these theories then as far as I could tell you you can perfectly well give a causal interpretation I mean there's a very clear sense in which this is just a generalization of the standard causal framework now what it says about causation and dynamical systems in general I think is still an open question I think I mean the point is not any arbitrary dynamical system can be represented causally this at most shows that there's a way when you have a certain type of dynamical system that you can represented causally uh so that is a bridge and I think it's an important bridge and uh and I like the bridge because lots of people don't know this but Herbert Simon was a Pioneer in the development of causal models going back to the 50s so as part of the structural equations tradition so to me it's helpful to have that continuity that the same person who was very influential and understanding what makes an equation structural and where the cly symmetry comes from that you can use that framework uh which sort of also influenced you all of the later Frameworks people know and love people like Speedo um spirit is G more and shinness you know so the fact that there's a continuity I think makes it easier as a philosopher to think about okay here's the case we understand here's the generalization what do we learn about causation speaking about history um in early 2010s uh we experienced the so-called Big Data Revolution one of the one of the driving ideas behind this Revolution was the idea that if we collect enough data we can make very useful predictions and actually solve any problem with this data I was curious on your perspective was this um concept do do you think that this concept was related to the ideas that Russell has presented and to thinking that causality is a really is something that is obsolete obsolete today as a causal person uh you're probably not going to be be surprised that I am suspicious of this because I think you know I mean causality really isn't about taking all the data you have and just throwing it into a machine or a grinder and getting a result causality is about making assumptions in order to take the complexity of the world and be able to in interact with it in a local and manageable way I that's what causality is about so so the whole idea of just throwing lots of data in something and seeing what comes out that goes against kind of what causal is trying to do uh I want to be careful here because I do think that for me it's a bit of an empirical question what the best approach is so I kind of when it comes to what's the best approach for building a large language model for example and you might say ah you can't possibly do that unless the machine knows the grammar or you come with all these philosophical conceptions and we still think like this yes and then someone gives you a machine that does it without that and I think you need to take that seriously so I'm very I'm not going to venture any predictions here I think whether you can or can't do something you know causely or non-causally I think yeah it's going to be an empirical question and we shouldn't just I I think you know I mean dennet has this idea like evolution is smarter than you and I think there's some corollary here that the idea of time evolution is smarter than you or natural selection is smarter than you it's just you know you thought there were you know n ways to do something but no there's this totally different way that things evolved and why couldn't that happen with technological um uh Evolution still not going to Grant it to wrestle here and because again I think that however things turn out what causal modeling is about is you know it it's just a different way of thinking about things it's not about if I'm given all the knowledge in the universe you know what can I do with that it's I'm a limited being operating at a particular time scale and I want to not have to know about everything happening in the universe to predict what will happen at this table or if you're a large language model um or or if you're or if you're a language model you might think plausibly okay you have this model that was trained on the entire internet and could predict the next word uh human beings were not trained on the whole internet so you still the fact that if you were trained in the whole internet you could answer your question X Y and Z does not answer the question of well how can someone who's only been exposed to a th000 words or 10,000 words uh learn grammar and yeah I'm not here advocating some radical Cham skin thing that again there's there's a lot that humans are doing there'll be many different models put out about how they do it and some of them will be more causal some less causal my point is whatever large language models are doing causal reasoning is doing something different and it's doing something I think is both valuable and certainly at least intuitively seems to me closer to what humans are doing when talking about the the dash Dash's paper you said that you see his perspective a little a bit more pessimistic and your perspective a little bit more optimistic at some point in your life you extensively studied the talmud is there an influence between your knowledge and your understanding of the tradition of thinking in talmud and and your work and how it influences the the your ability to take different perspectives I have no idea if this is the right causal story but this is what seems right to me through introspection uh it does seem to me that so I mean ttic literature it's very much like a legal style of literature and the way it functions is that in some ways I mean the the text is fixed you know so there's these different sources but you're trying to triangulate them and you're trying to get a a bigger picture by you know we have you know this Source from this Century this Source from this century and what do we think is the right one and this Rabbi says this this Rabbi says that and I think that inspires a certain flexibility of thought that certainly has helped me um so I mean I don't know how directly appli to causal models but I think it's partly why I think that you know what matters about causal models is what if when they're wrong because it's really not about oh I'm going to get the final model that's going to solve everything it's like let me find a systematic way to explore this let me build a model might be wrong but I'll still learn something I mean I certainly the the time I most felt that this influenced me so uh so one of my projects that we haven't talked about yet is about uh the causal analysis of racial discrimination and after a while of doing that as more of a causal modeling and sociology uh related discipline eventually I had a really fruitful conversation with the legal scholar Issa caller housan I learned a tremendous amount from but also made me realize I really needed to look at the legal literature on discrimination if I was going to be you know continuing to write about this uh and I spent you know a good summer kind of doing a deep dive to at least Orient myself about how they talk about this and I certainly I mean it was labor intensive I certainly found that I was able to do it in a way that I I'm not sure I would have been able to do had I not had the talic training because I think I just uh had had some basic feel for how legal systems work um especially I was looking at you know case law for Supreme Court cases and that least something in the field brought me back to uh you know to the earlier days yeah you also you also read Islamic Sufi text what did you find interesting about them I mean I guess one thing I noticed when I was doing this and this is back in a course at Columbia University with Peter an who you was one of my favorite professors at Columbia and I think there just something that happens with like lots of mystical Traditions whether it's the subie text or cabala where there's kind of like something a bit different than the rest of the more traditional religion I mean you really uh and I haven't thought about this stuff in a very long time so I don't know the long-term influence on me but there's a a real emphasis on human experience and there's a real emphasis on how to reconcile imminence and Transcendence uh and it's given in a theological context but I mean I think the question about how to reconcile you what feels to you like your own personal experience and you know and what yeah feels very individual um with whatever broader system you think makes the World function I mean I think I think that really fascinated me I mean it's probably why back in the day I used to read lot of kard I think it it was a similar type of dilemma that's for period of time in college I was very obsessed with who would you like to thank so I definitely uh owe a tremendous amount to my graduate school adviser um Dan hman who really uh at the point I was working with him I mean he hadn't really written on cality in a good 10 20 years but just was an amazing advisor and uh really just kind of someone who when when I had half baked ideas he could sort of finish them I mean I think there's different you should speak to everyone you can when you're working on an idea but for someone who's an advisory role someone who you can bring ideas that are not fully developed and for them to kind of be in the same wavelength that's really important at that stage uh so um yeah so he was tremendously helpful and uh and has been extremely supportive earlier Elliot sober on another philosopher in the department he uh on one on the first paper I wrote in grad school at least the first paper I wrote for him which largely due to him ended up being published but uh um yeah he I think gave me feedback on six drafts you know of that the first three might not have been particularly that good but kind of that type of feedback was just indispensable and I worry sometimes that students at all levels don't get kind of scenario where they just need to revise the same paper which is where I think a lot where a lot of the action happens uh in recent years uh Jim Woodward has been extremely supportive and has been just a great collaborator yeah I'm sure I'm forgetting people and I don't mean any offense but those were some of the names of uh when people are starting with something more complex and this is often the case when they are starting with causality they might feel a little bit overwhelmed or unsure if they will be able to grasp all the terminology all the tools that are needed to uh do causality in practice what what would be your advice for them it really is important to find some aspect that you know I find interesting and it relates to other interests of mine so almost by Chance the first thing that I came across were debates over the causal faithful inness condition uh sort of parmon principle for causal inference and that gave me an in and I do think ideally having something like that is important because if you're not interested it's very hard to to you know get inside and once you have that you can sort of take whatever knowledge you have and Branch out so I'm not sure what practical advice that means in terms of how to find uh that particular thing I mean certainly with a book that's you know relatively accessible like the book of why that might be a good place to start to kind of see the landscape but the truth is that there's many Avenues into causal inference so if you're interested in algorithms uh there's the whole literature on algorithms uh for doing causal inference and you know if you're philosophy there's a whole lot of work uh that's based on that uh so yeah I think there's many Avenue Avenues in and finding one that works for you is important and then going from there and and certainly I don't at least the way I do things and maybe it's not the most efficient but it at least works for me is I think it's not important that the first thing you do is the most important thing or to do something cuz you think that's going to be to answer the question you want I think if there's some random book about causation that's broadly you know connected to this literature and you find it interesting yeah delve into it I think uh don't overthink where you start if it's something that appeals to you uh my experiences is that it often takes me a while to figure out why I care about something but I've never regretted kind of just delving into something long before I could explain to anyone why why I cared about it or why it should matter and what kept to going when you already started well the good thing about causation uh I think in any field certainly in philosophy is there's really uh no end to it I mean so for me uh as a philosopher one of the exciting things is that I'm you know able to engage with lots of different sciences and do it in a way I think is fruitful because lots of Sciences care about causation already so it's not like I need to learn everything about the science I need to find scientists who already care about it and then engage with with them and with the appropriate degree of modesty and you understanding my own limitations but that's been very fruitful for me uh that's for example how I've had a wonderful collaboration with the Dutch psychometrics Community uh exactly that way and every project I've start I felt like an impostor but I think causality is great for really being able to do interdisciplinary work in a substantive and general way uh now in terms of what keeps me personally going I think well I think compared to when I just got the PHD which is already quite a while back I think I just at some point felt like I had something to say so I think uh uh today we've only talked about sort of a small part of my research but I think L of the issues we've covered about what causation is how causal models work issues of time scale I think those are radically important and underappreciated and because it's connected to a yeah a topic of causation that's of increasing interest in both Academia and outside of Academia uh it's really a wonderful way to pursue my interests and also be able to hopefully in the long run make a contribution to lots of areas so that's very exciting and I mean in that sense I just feel lucky I mean that I found a topic that you know both that interests me and that I feel like I can make a contribution uh there are many people out there that are way smarter than me and if they turned to this then I guess i''d be out of a job but somehow my training and the various people I've supported me and the direction I decided to go has so far uh been very fruitful and nice and so yeah I mean I just find it a very exciting area to work in and I think there's just a tremendous amount to do um because as much as people have talked about causality I think things have just gotten started what question would you like to ask me one thing I've noticed in terms of your orientation um is that that uh so of course you're speaking to me and I'm an academic based at University but clearly your interests are focused on you largely on causation and Industry and uh I know you've interviewed or considering interviewing people that work for you know places like Uber or or vault or things like that and I'm I'm curious how you see the interaction between sort of the causal researchers in Academia and outside of Academia and should they be communicating uh will that be fruitful that's a great question um I think they can be fruitful and we still have a little bit of work to do in order to build more bridges one of the main motivations for for this podcast from the scientific and communal point of view was to bring different perspectives and different schools of thought to one platform so we can we can have we can build an a sort of an agor Agora for conversations between those different worlds I think you referred to this uh also today that some of the communi so some of the styles of thinking are ghettoized in a sense like we we have those ghettos in causality potential outcomes and uh single World intervention graphs and and dags and then we have different schools of thought in epidemiology and in econometrics and computer science and often those different the different different Clans they are talking about the same thing but just using slightly different language I think opening this discussion and opening the doors between Windows and closed rooms is something that we really need in order to move the field forward but also to promote the usage and application of causality in Industry because many of the problems that people in Industry are facing today might be already solved in one of the niches but they just don't know about this because they read the the literature coming from the other side yeah I kind agree more yeah and even sometimes when the same thing has been covered in two literatures you don't know how to compare them or so yeah or translate them yeah yeah yeah I find it challenging as well I'm I'm I'm reading Robbins for instance Hannah and Robbins and um when I was writing my book and and researching the literature um like building a bridge for me from pean language to their language and back this required a significant amount of work although the ideas sometimes are very very similar but the terminology is completely different you need a dictionary to actually understand how this translates now I think something someone could do one of these days is sort of a do YouTube channel in which uh they sort of uh have different videos on the different intros to causal inference and kind of compare them I mean of course there's would have to be a CLE scholar already and uh I'm not sure I have the time but uh but certainly this is something where I think there's a great need for uh projects like this so yes I'm really glad that you're doing it what resources would you recommend to people starting with causality it can be books courses well some of the things I find myself recommending um and it's always hod podge of things cuz I haven't found one thing that kind of is a one siiz fits all uh but some of the things I tend to recommend depending my audience uh so first of all Felix elart sociology sociologist at Wisconsin he has a handbook for causality sorry he has a chapter in a handbook for causality I don't remember the publisher but it will be easy to find with we will put a link in the description um and I find that that's really good for social scientists and also it covers a lot of good stuff it covers confounding covers desparation uh covers endogenous selection bias and also some methods such as time bearing treatments that are less covered elsewhere but are still important so that's one thing that I think is very good bang for your buck a companion piece to that uh it's more specialized but him and Chris winchip at Harvard uh they have a a paper on endogenous selection bias so that's conditioning on a collider that's not a general introduction to causal inference but it's one of those um topics that it's very counterintuitive to people and very unknown and one of things can give you flavor of graphs um something else I recommend is um and this is for people if they're more interested in the algorithmic side uh so there's a piece by Frederick eard uh at Caltech who's by the way in general one of the you know uh certainly people with philosophical training yeah one of the uh or the most exciting people people doing causal research these days uh so um he has somewhere um I think in 2012 kind of a very short introduction to uh causal inference algorithms we're saying maybe 12 page Oran it's some yeah I don't know it's 10 pages or but it's very short and covers the different algorithms does it quickly but it covers both some of the more traditional ones also covers some of the machine learning algorithms so one of the big advances has been in you know work from machine learning where traditional causal Al algorithms can't solve the two variable problem so if x causes y y causes X and you haven't measured any other variables you can't determine causal direction there's some machine learning methods um you know which exploits exploit parametric features of the error term that allow one to determine caal Direction and I think ard's discussion is nice the other discussion for that if you want more detail is the textbook by shelov um Yan Singh and uh um Peters so but that's a more involved uh Deep dive okay and then maybe just a few more so one really random one but guy neelson on his website who had an introduction to desparation which still to me is the most accessible um uh introduction to desparation I believe the guy's name is Michael neelsen uh and study something like Quantum Computing or something but just at some point did a deep dive into Pearl's book and wrote this nice piece and finally uh recently I did an article in the Stanford encyclopedia philosophy on Simpsons Paradox I wouldn't say that would necessarily be the first thing to read but um if you're interested in how the causal modeling methods relate to some of the earlier philosophical theories including probalistic theories I discussed that a bit there especially so in the early SE of that are the mathematical Framing and that's sort of Standalone and you can go as deep or shallow into that as you want but I think something that hinders philosophers from understanding the newer methods is that there's kind of a discontinuity between in the 20th century when people who do probabilistic theories of causality and we more traditional philosophical theories and then you have all these axiomatic theories and causal graphs and how do they relate and so at least there I try to explain you know really what the advances were like why having causal graphs gives you you know a proper theory of confounding and and historically why I think the probalistic theorists didn't have that um and it's all a very uh yeah for example you a pearl inspired picture but at least I tried to put the pieces together there where can people find out more about yourself and and your work probably the best thing is my website so all my articles are there uh I'm also on Twitter as you mentioned thanks to my mother and uh on my Twitter as my pinned tweet I just gave thumbnails to uh a bunch of papers that I thought would be relevant so yeah so I think uh those would be the most direct ways to get an overview what's your message to the cutle community so what I want to say is that I still think there's lots of questions we're not asking so there's been a huge amount of development in the algorithmic side and that's been massively fruitful and certainly been the inspiration for lots of my research I think people sometimes think that because you know no causes in no causes out because you can't get causal outputs without causal assumptions that kind of all you can do is you know give axioms you could say here's you causal markup causal faithfulness minimality and that's all there is and I think that's just not true um because it it is so it is true that you can't get a reductive Theory at least I don't think you can give an account of causation that says what causation is without using the word cause or using some concept like EX gen which builds in causes but I still think there's a different project we can been engaging in and it's a project having to do with the conditions of causal representation uh so to think really about what are the types of systems to which these models apply uh so one thing uh we talked about yesterday was I think sometimes a model might work and we might not know why it works and I think that can happen I think sometimes you say here's my algorithm here's the assumptions we don't think the assumptions are correct and the gthm still gives us something that seems sort of okay and then there's a question of why and I think that gets obscured by the purely you know axiomatic computer science if then approach and one reason why I'm really interested in the time scale of thing is I think that that's an antidote to that I think you can't say what exogeneity is without using the word cause but you can say here's how facts about Exogen will be relative to time scale and that tells you about the conditions under which causal models apply uh this one example I mean it's my pet example it's the one I like but I just think there's a lot more work to be done to that and and I guess sometimes people get defensive where if you say oh there's a limitation of the model that somehow you're saying the model is bad or it's not I mean you are saying it's not the whole picture but somehow you're criticizing it and I just think the the fun of modeling is use the models see where they work and then see where they break down and then use that to figure out what the fix looks like and is it a big fix or small fix I mean I think it should all be part of the picture so I just really think there are a lot of projects uh that neither philosophers nor computer scientists are doing uh and I hope that at least in a small way my research at least points people in other directions or at least encourages people to look in other directions uh where you there's a lot of work to be done one of the questions that people in an industry are asking is themselves or or asking this question to others is is causality one of those trends that just come and go or is it something that that will stay here for longer yeah I mean uh like lots of other parts of the interview I'm not going to make any predictions about well probably anything but certainly not about industry and what shiny new object they're going to find next I think you know I mean as a philosopher I can ask the question about you know is it a valuable thing to care about and I can give lots of reasons that's valuable and for all that people will often say oh this problem is purely predictive I think it's very hard to find a purely predictive problem often because often people you know don't or typically especially in Industry people don't just care about making predictions people do care about intervening and even if you don't you really don't just care about correlations you care about the correlations that will remain in variant uh and maybe you need causation Maybe you don't but correlation and stats are not going to do that by themselves at least that's not what they're designed for yeah as we talked about maybe you add enough data and the Machine will figure it out but that's just not what they're designed for so I think the easy part in some ways is to explain why it is that someone would want you know this type of tool I think the hard part is actually teaching people how to use it and I don't mean that in a way like oh because people won't understand it because people don't have the knowledge I think it's really a question of implementation and incentives and it's not enough for something to be useful I think it needs to also be useful in a way that can easily be used to apply to the problems as people see them and I think both in science and in Industry I suspect there's still lots of gaps there that um is another one of those things that's not totally clear who the best person is to to jump in and help but I think it's a it's a non-n negligible problem and I mean something I've seen with Scientists so which again I've had more contact with them than with industry is that you could teach them the Pearl stuff and they they get it perfectly fine but they don't know how to use it in the papers they're writing or if they don't know how to use it to publish the Articles they need to or if the journals they're submitting to won't recognize it it's they're not going to use it I mean like for the most part you'll have a few methodologists who will use it and I'll hang out with those people and we'll have fun but but in terms of like actually changing a field that's where I kind of see the possible stop Gap so we might need a change management expert now not another yeah fality specialist yeah I mean it's always and then it's always you know I'm always nervous to encourage people to hire more managers but there's you know but uh yeah there's definitely uh this is something someone needs to be thinking about um yes naali thank you it was a pleasure to talk to you thank you pleas to meet yeah it was a great pleasure I really enjoyed it thank you and see you in the next episode congrats on reaching the end of this episode of the CLE Bandits podcast stay tuned for the
