and what I personally felt is when I've talked to the stakeholders it could be also the business experts the data scientists one thing everybody says is that it just makes sense a lot of people are always scared when we talk about Cal and all because it's just so good so they'll be are replacing my job what I wanted to do is that maybe I use llms to see that how the external world is can affect some of the suppliers but the result I got was really hey Cal Bandits welcome to the causal Bandits podcast the best podcast on causality and machine learning on the inter internet today we're traveling back to Munich to meet our guest he realized the potential of data at the age of 10 while being a cricket player he's a passionate traveler who visited 25 countries and lived in five he loves polish pirogi and a good time at the gym makes him happy lead data scientist at BMW group and a truly entrepreneurial Spirit ladies and Gentlemen please welcome Mr isan Gupta let me pass it to your host Alex molac ladies and gentlemen please welcome ishan Gupta thanks a lot for this warm introduction and happy to be here happy to have you here isans where are we today so we are in this beautiful uh city in Germany Munich in the Bavarian area and it happens to be a beautiful lovely day sunny and warm and especially at this time of the year to have this it's always exciting and uh beautiful how did you end up leing in this beautiful city so so uh it's it's it's a long story uh I've always been wanting to live abroad uh started with my fascination of wanting to be in us then uh during my bachelor's in India I got a chance to uh travel to Cairo for an internship as a website developer really liked the international experience of being abroad and uh I knew that this is what I want want to do and even at that time I really wanted to be still in us uh but then got this chance to be in Poland uh in 2016 and 2017 uh and 2018 Winter to just uh explore Europe travel around but also to teach data science to the youth and also improve their language skills and I really liked what I learned when I got a chance to visit Germany over Christmas uh really liked uh the word free education it something resonated with me in a in a in in an amazing way and then yeah just uh applied to German University got uh full scholarship in one of the universities in Northern Germany and uh that's how I um landed here in Germany you mentioned web development um so data science was not the only thing that you're interested in uh within this broader field of computer science uh tell me about the day when you felt that machine learning and causality in particular is something that you cannot imagine yourself in the future without I mean I did my bachelor's in computer sence science and uh one thing I always was sure that it's a vast area like computer science there are a lot of things to do from website development to Android development and this then comes this P data thing with all the data science artificial intelligence so I wanted to explore different things try out different things and then wanted to see that what suits me so I started uh through website development uh then I went to Android development and um then I got a chance to uh go into data science app absolutely love uh data science working with numbers predicting stuff and just being ahead of the game it started with my fascination of just uh predicting something with the stocks because I'm also into stock Investments and then also just predicting that uh if my team will do uh good or uh bad so it just started with with a hobby then it became profession and then I always felt that there was this missing thing in data science especially when it comes to the explainability part there's always blackbox modeling and and in the end it's just mere predictions and not business recommendations so one thing also about me is I come from an entrepreneurship background so I always like to keep my entrepreneurship hat on so whatever may come the situation so when I am a data scientist I'm predicting something working in a corporate I'm not just thinking as a data scientist predicting I want to make a difference and um I want to have some actionable insights and that's one thing I always felt missing and then I came into cality and I I saw that just connecting the missing puzzle and that's uh really what I liked what I what I learned uh in in cal machine learning because it really was able to um I'll say cover the areas of explainability um blackbox modeling and then it was way more than just prediction it was also business recommendation and then just the capability to do what if uh contrafactual uh scenarios so that's how I came into cal machine learning field what was the first moment when you heard about cality it started with just meere Googling so imagine just me just Googling some of the stuffs like explainability or also how how I can input the tribal knowledge into my models which will be still different than human reinforcement learning and yeah then uh while I was researching during my uh PhD I could to know about uh this cal machine learning and uh saw some of the videos saw some of the talks there were not enough and I'm talking about around 3 to 4 years ago even then it was not a lot of stuff about uh caal machine learning then read this book the book of Why by Judah PE um amazing book and uh yeah I mean that's when I got into cal machine learning and uh that's how I really wanted to know a bit more about that your PhD program uh was combining theoretical work research work we've applied practical um s can you tell us a little bit more about your PhD what was what was its main focus and its connection to causality and causal learning uh yes sure so um one thing I also liked about Germany is uh they have these PHD programs where you can work in industry and then also still connected with to uh academics so personally I've never wanted to do PhD uh but just just I really liked when I got to know about these kind of programs uh in Germany I applied to one and just just an idea to still do some uh practical work from what you have learned in the research papers and it's not just just researching it's also development was super exciting for me because I'm usually one of those guys who will read something on LinkedIn or some of the research papers and really want to do it right away where in a conventional PhD sometimes you just don't get a chance because you are really stuck in the literature review you really really really want to go deep into that and it's still going deep but it still gives you the chance of um practically applying what you have learned and best part is seeing right away the results in the industry that how it can affect some of the business decisions maybe we can end up saving a lot of money maybe we can influence some other things so that's pretty exciting for me so what was the main topic of interest that you focused your attention on in your in your PhD work yes so uh I come from supply chain background supply chain has always been interesting for me also why because where I did my master from northern Germany in uh data engineering few of my batchmates they they came from the Supply Chain management and we also used to have some of the classes uh combined and I really liked uh to know a bit more about supply chain because I saw a lot of use cases combining uh machine learning there so um and yeah I mean really wanted to go into Supply Chain management and right now if you see the supply chain it's uh really complex I think more than never because you combine things like the geopolitical issues or you talk about the pandemics like Corona or you talk about uh the semiconductor issue which is specifically affecting the automotive industry a lot I see it these are Urgent problems that needs to be addressed but it's also an opportunity for the companies to be ahead of the game and uh that's that's where I see a big use of machine learning and especially causal machine learning coming into play helping the business requirement owners uh make uh better uh data back decisions but also not just uh predictions part business recommendations what challenges do you think uh causal machine learning can can address in supply chain the traditional Solutions statistical machine learning Solutions cannot address so I'll I I'll talk it in a way of um some of the conversations I had with the management or for example I worked in different industries from uh Sports IND industry to now working uh in automotive when you talk to these people uh as a data scientist you go to them um they have a big responsibility to make uh pick decisions and they'll always ask you the questions like okay explain me the model talk to me about that what exactly cost something and tell me the next step and it seems a very obvious question and it is but sometimes the data scientists still struggle explaining them about the accuracy scores the root mean Square then you talk about the postto explainability methods like L and shap and this is exactly we start losing those stakeholders because they just don't believe in them they don't want to play around with it and uh that's that's where the Gap is so what what I felt or what I wanted to research upon is that how about we try to compare the traditional descriptive and diagnostic analytics with the predictive part and then the ca analytics and then see that how stakeholders feel about that and the results we got were really satisfying but yeah I mean coming to the problems addressing part I think the explainability part they're really explainable the models because of the causal Discovery graphs then you can run these simulations the what if simulations uh you can play around have different simulations so not only historical simulation but also the future uh scenarios which gives trust to the management so in the end I always try to relate it with the trust Factor because the stakeholders they trust it more why also is because their knowledge is sometimes in the models so they actually see it as an extension of their own brain and and and they really like to play around with it and they they they really enjoy it and maybe the models won't be the best or the perfect models initially but eventually they do become because the management the trust in it and they want to make it better I had a very interesting conversation some time ago with Hanan U from Vault or Walt um and he shared with me that in his practice this is very common to build causal models in an iterative fashion so rather than thinking about just defining all relevant parameters in advance and then running some computations and going home we would rather build something maybe overly simplified but something that we are pretty sure about and then iterate over this triangulate the results of the model with real data over time collect more expert knowledge over time and improve this structural information up to the point where where the model uh gives us something something useful uh is this iterative approach something that you could also relate to in your work I do and I think it's an really good strategy because initially we as people we try to hit the home run every time but in corporate it's not always the best strategy why because people uh you always need to have the trust from the stakeholders you start small you start simple and I think then you build on to something beautiful is always right right strategy but there's a fine line between making something simple but also you also want to give these stakeholders something extra because then they'll always say that ah okay I don't need a model to tell you let's say my worst supplier because I already know it uh that this will be my worst supplier if I see the trend so you always need to give them some something extra but I think starting from something small something simple is always a good strategy and then you can always build onto it to something more beautiful you mentioned causal Discovery at some point as well we know that causal Discovery might be very challenging in real world settings because of the limitations of the methods and we can have some we have some theorems showing that those challenges are deeply ingrained in the I I don't want to say in reality but uh let's say in in this thinking about about causality there there are some fundamental limitations um what was your experience with those methods and how did you deal with the challenge that we cannot have a guarantee that those methods give us reliable results yes so I mean I'll say these models are of course not not the most perfect but I think we as humans also are not the perfect so uh there are always human biases existing but I see caal Discovery or caal machine learning in general as a way to reduce this human biases so my experience with these algorithms have been pretty positive so uh I've done the study where I've interview different experts and try to come up with a tribal knowledge graph of let's say that how the external world or external factors or these news are affecting say so the backlogs of the suppliers or you can change uh any kind of different use case if you want to predict something why and you want to understand that what are different factors affecting it so uh in the end you'll have this uh beautiful tribal Knowledge Graph U which you can take it as the ground truth so what I personally wanted to test it out that I just throw in the data and let these algorithms run this caal discovery algorithm and then see that how close it to the ground truth because now I already have this beautiful ground truth and the results I got was really satisfying uh which I was pleasantly surprised I tried out different algorithms saw some of the results which were really close to the ground truth but I also always feel that you need a business Expert at some stage always who can testify that okay this is something that makes sense or maybe you correct this particular Edge and it'll make more sense and it can even get the uh business Expert thinking that maybe this could make sense and uh that's always the exciting part so for me I think I'll say that these algorithms are not perfect and but but like I started so are we what would be your advice to people who would like to apply causal Discovery algorithms in in their use cases um what what what would be the main lessons that you would like to share with those people so I say just first get your hands dirty and just try try them out uh what always is necessary is you have to also look at what kind of relationship is between the data whether it's linear nonlinear uh and of course you still have to follow the conventional methods of um data science data engineering and general you have to work with the clean data you have to do all those stuff but you're getting hand stdy try try out different things try try out different visualizations and then have always this domain expert try to validate it it's definitely will be one of my uh biggest lessons and uh the teachings that I'll give give to the people try out different algorithms I think there are some really good algorithms existing open source and um then see how how the results are for this part of our audience that is interested more in technical details which algorithms worked well in your case I think PC algorithm is is always uh a good one particularly for my use case if I uh have to share so I use this algorithm called resist uh performed really beautifully well uh where I wanted to compare that how the tribal knowledge craft that I obtained from interviewing the experts like around 25 experts uh can I get something close to by by using these algorithms and resist perform really really well and what I wanted to predict is uh get the schal discovery graph of how different internal supplier performance G apis let's say backlogs or wrong deliveries or special transports which are very general kpis in supply chain uh but they are still not straightforward that how they are connected to one another and uh the caal discovery graph I got was really really close to the ground truth but that also means like some other algorithms um like like like I said PC and all it doesn't mean that they are not good or bad it just it depends solely to that particular task and that particular thing that you want to predict or if it's suitable for your kind of data what have you learned about interviewing the subject matter experts uh during this process you said you interviewed 25 people what would be the main lessons that you could share with the community to make this process more effortless for them so ining experts is I'll say one of the more necessary things and it is really necessary or it can be amazing uh in cal machine learning models later on so so interviewing them first you have to do it in a very non-biased way so maybe I can also recommend some of the methods like multi criteria decision ship making methods specifically you can use FHP aut topsis or analytic hierarchy process I think they're really good which ensures that there's some consistency in when you are interviewing the experts there are no human biases and then you have this uh normal conversation with them and try to find this cause and effect relationships let's say for example in my use case I wanted to know that how the external world is affecting uh the backlogs of my suppliers or different KP of my suppliers so so you talk with them you try to together build this tribal knowledge uh graph with them and then testify and uh I think one one thing also is that usually even experts won't realize initially that they know uh that that much so that was a very interesting observation that I have found and I'll sit down with them for a hour or two workshop and in the end we'll have this beautiful DH graph and uh even they'll be like yeah okay this is really really amazing so one thing is just just keep asking those questions motivating them to to tell more ask uh things in detail and uh yeah in the end like still get that particular graph validated and make sure that it's a DH so that it could be utilized in uh cal machine learning we we had a dinner together yesterday and I remember you said one thing that I really I really loved um that is related to what you're speaking about now that constructing those graphs is a way of course it's a way of gathering information valuable information but also it's a way of in a sense building a monument for the knowledge of people uh in the organization so even if somebody was for 30 years in the organization maybe this person is retiring now or just changing the the company uh their knowledge the the legacy is somehow saved in this in this graphical structure and I found it very very beautiful so yeah and talking about that like it's always beautiful for me to know that for example Ive worked in different Industries different companies and just to know that maybe some of my work is still existing in the company and is creating a difference it's always amazing and trying to relate it with cal machine learning or these cfts is that I always imagine it as a chance that to utilize all these abundance of knowledge existing in these experts and just utilizing in U making a difference and even when the leave company that knowledge somehow still stays within the company and I think it's really really beautiful and that's where even the companies in corporate they'll have the best uh usage of of of these experts and um yeah I think it's already kind of a plus situation and a win-win situation because you as an expert will be thinking that okay my knowledge will always be existing within the company in these models I'll always even though I'll leave the company I'll still be able to make a difference and I think this gives gives you happiness and also for company I think it's beautiful that they invested a lot lot in a person and their knowledge can be utilized in able to make these uh differences so the impact is is lasting impact is lasting and impact is lo lasting forever many people in in the Cal Community um are considering today the ways that we could Leverage The Power of Genera creative AI in order to make causal learning causal processes causal Discovery more efficient faster um or maybe just better what are your thoughts about this intersection of those two Fields exciting to begin with and yeah I've tried to explore that too so uh one of the challenges or I'll also say when I used to interview these expert was it takes a lot of time to gather that meaningful relation ships and the D it it takes a lot of time by asking them a lot of questions and um for example in general it'll take at least two three hours to interview an experts and if you are talking about interviewing 25 experts it's more than 50 hours it's it's it's a lot of time and sometimes in corporate you don't find uh that much time now the role of uh of llms how I see is that it can be definitely used to expedite the process of caal discovery so now what I'm saying is that instead of starting from scratch uh with these experts where I'll have little to no knowledge about uh their domain I just go to llms and try to find these caal relationships build already a caal discovery graph and then uh let the expert validate it or he can criticize it which is also good for me and eventually they'll build on to that because what we have also learned is that people really like to criticize they really like to but also they want to validate things also because they want to show their knowledge and uh I think it's a good way of instead of starting from scratch have something and then build something way more meaningful to that and um I want to share this experience is that the research I was working on where I was interviewing this experts more than 40 to 50 hours uh saw these interesting um papers with llms and kajal AI then really wanted to utilize llms uh I was not expecting a lot because what I wanted to do is is that maybe I use llms to see that how the external world is can affect some of the suppliers but the result I got was really close to the ground truth just after one or two prompts so that really got me thinking is that just after two or three prompts you can get so amazing results which is so closer to the ground growth and that definitely makes sense of instead of starting things from scratch using this as a recommendation and then build something more meaningful meaningful to that so it's it sounds to me like it's not not only an efficiency booster it's also an additional element that can motivate your experts your experts to uh to give you to give you uh more of their knowledge share more of their knowledge because they want to show that their knowledge is there and they want to share it with the world uh yes so I think even they had some of the surprising reactions to what what they learned uh what what the llms can do and the potential but in a really good way because uh they they appreciate uh what these models were recommending in the Cal Discovery graph but yeah of course they wanted to add more into that because they wanted to show show their knowledge they wanted to show their unique experiences which I'm pretty sure in every industry every expert will have some of the unique experiences despite of uh whatever length they have been at their company but yeah it was really satisfying to see that thing and yeah I think it builds more trust and I think uh future of most Industries personally I feel and especially in supply chain I see is it's not just about better technology or more technology but I think better trust and I think caal Discovery really really helps us bridge that trust deficit what are your thoughts about evaluating systems like this so evaluation I think it's still a challenge even in a caal world but that's where I've always felt the role of stakeholders or these business experts becomes even bigger it it's definitely it does not reduce but what happens is that we make makes things simpler for them by by by making these causal uh Discovery uh visualizations where they can see all these edges so they can see the effect it can have when they take a certain action they can run simulations and I think simulation capability these contrafactual capability something always management wants and uh there's always a caal question In The End by the management so if they can already run through it that's where uh even though initially the model won't be perfect it will be eventually when they start playing around with with it and that's where I I I know that there are these data evaluation metrics also in the caal world like talking about the caal discovery methods we have the shts Hamming distance number of indirect edges but I like to read on those numbers but not totally depend on that because eventually like I said the role of the stakeholders and these business experts is still a lot especially in the causal world I think it becomes even even more at some point in your career you worked for a famous German uh football club called ver bman do you see that causality can also be applied in the context of sports yeah I think it it it definitely is not restricted towards um any particular industry so for example if I want to know that maybe what caused a uh Sports person injury so doing this root cause analysis and also I could maybe play around with some of the variables so if I want to say that okay XY Z player what if this person will sleep 8 hours instead of the 6 hours he's sleeping right now what effect uh it could have on the match performance let's say the expected goals which is a really important kpi that that we try to track in the sports industry or maybe just just in him getting injured or not which is again a really important kpi because in sports industry also we always want to know what's the status of the person whether he'll be injured or not because that could really make or break a team so uh I think the potential is immense and not only restricted towards a specific industry like sports or Automotive it can be apply to pretty much everywhere is the future causal I think it's already the present particularly uh I see that it has been highlighted way more because of the recent events and yes specifically relating with the supply chain with all these uh issues that I mentioned earlier with the Eastern European war or these pandemic and the semiconductor issue definitely got highlighted a bit more and people really realize that there is a need of something more and there is something missing about these These are blackbox models in the end so that's where I feel that uh a lot of companies have gone into this uh caal World exploring things and even implementing it right away so I'll say um in future it'll be even more and lately I've seen the trend in the past one year it has definitely expedite but uh I see definitely a lot of companies using it right now and in future it it'll only increased what would be your advice for companies that are interested in applying causal methodology causal inference caal Discovery in their work but they don't know what should be the first or the first two three steps uh to take so I see um an interesting uh thing in the companies where it's very common for them to go this descriptive diagnostic way to predictive and then the prescriptive part so I always like to associate kajal AI with this prescriptive part more and in the end like it's always about what the business wants and uh that's where the caal AI comes into the play so my advice also always is to why not move straight forward into this world of actionable intelligence why causal intelligence instead of just going this latter way because eventually what most of the companies already realize is that when we do this predictive way uh we don't go beyond the experimental phase a lot because of of of these common problems about the explainability and the stress deficit and um people don't trust these postto explainability methods so just trying out this actionable intelligence and it definitely needs a bit of research too U because it's not that straightforward it's something new also for the most of the data scientists working in the industry so to start with a bit of research but then trying it out and what I personally felt is when I've have talk to the stakeholders it could be also the business experts the data scientists one thing everybody says is that it just makes sense and uh I think even if these companies are not using it right now they will eventually because of the of these issues so they don't have a choice and uh I think um causal is something that will definitely help them many people starting with causality they experience something that I call the fundamental fear of causality which is asking the question how do I know if my dag is is correct what what would you say to those people so I mean um it also comes to the evaluation metrics part so that's where I'll potentially answer in the same line that yes you can always throw them these numbers regarding uh the Hamming distance the shts number of indirect edges you you can do your best and I think it's always always required because not only you have to talk to the stakeholders but you have to discuss it with other data scientists and that's where you can throw them all these metrics but eventually it just comes down to the business experts so what we also are doing is that a lot of people people are always scared when we talk about Cal Ai and all because it's just so good so they'll be are you replacing my job but when they actually try it out there they always think that it's extension of 100% their own knowledge so just involving them a bit more in this process of the evaluation is always a always a good idea and I think that's always the way where they will be like okay we are pretty sure that okay this Ed makes sense uh but okay this thing definitely does not make sense it's always also a good idea about interviewing multiple experts uh because then again we'll have this human bias bias problem so always good to have uh in different experts in the scenario yes if we don't have experts then it's a very different uh scenario but usually in corporate of course you will have the these tribal knowledge and the the experts uh but in that case um definitely you can only give the data Evolution metrics you mentioned that one of the challenges you see in uh broader application of causality is that data scientists themselves might not be familiar with with the methods what would be the two free resources that you'd recommend data scientists interested in this topic to start with so I think it's very mental thing also because uh it's it's something hard to believe that something like this exist and when you talk about all these assumptions and do calculates it's something very different and most of the people they they have not learned it um in their education so I'll always recommend them to start with this book of the book of why which also Chang will change their mindset and I think specifically lately this book uh caal inance and Discovery in Python by you I think it's it's a revolutionary book if I have to put it that way uh because one thing is people of python and uh about this book one thing I really like is also learning by doing you see all these examples you first learn their Theory and uh then you just apply right away and you see the results and I think that's where people will have more ideas they' be like okay this is something I can associate with my use case let me try this thing uh you talk about the connection with the llms and you talk also about NLP and when you talk about all these familiar things the data scientists people will know that okay it's not a foreign language it's just um you are learning to do something in in an even better way and there's no harm to that so initially I'll definitely go the more the mental way to remove that particular barrier in the in the mind and then just test it out and uh I think uh a lot of data scientists struggled in the test part because they did not had a lot of resources yes we have these open source libraries like DUI and all but um not not a lot but now with with these books and some other books coming in the market right now and amazing research papers I think people can just get their hands dirty and try out different things which research papers did you find personally meaningful or important in your journey into cality I'll say the most interesting one recently I was reading with uh um from Microsoft where to combine the llms and uh the Ki methods so that was particularly interesting for me and uh again the part of what you learn just try to apply it right away of course you will not always have that uh chance to do that because of the time or some other constraints but particularly I like that and I just uh used it in my particular use case and I saw the results and uh they were very much in line with what Microsoft was claiming so one tip all always will be to keep in Trend with all these research papers and uh I think LinkedIn is an amazing resource and a very underrated tool so I'll see the post from uh all these caal ambassadors including you or some other companies and I'll always be thinking about some different uh problems in the caal way caal world and uh there's answer right away so one other tip will be to just always connect with these people on LinkedIn ask them questions because that will also get them thinking because I always love to read these comment sections whenever someone is posting a research paper about cality and all and they'll be like okay maybe you could have done this way also I love the way you did it so um I think I think it's a brilliant Community right now on LinkedIn and um definitely one of the underrated tips um here in your career you you were many hats so you were an entrepreneur you worked for for a sports team you work you you currently work for an uh one of the leading World leading automotive company um what was the real role of networking in your path so networking is even uh I think one of the most important things and um the more you climb the letter Inc corporate the more you realize that it's all about getting the right people in a meeting to get things done and you might say that it's a very easy thing but it's not it's the easiest thing in the world and the most difficult thing in the world uh at the same time so even in my use case when I had to utilize these caal Discovery get it testified by the expert or interview all these expert you need networking because it's not straightforward you have to convince them to talk about like uh for hours like two hours three hours discussing about their tribal knowledge so networking is always huge and I also like to do a different kind of networking where I'll talk to different kind of demographics people from a very different field like it could be a lawyer friend or someone who is into a medical field and try to uh discuss my my problems that I'm facing in the industry and get their point of view and sometimes you will have the most amazing ideas like that so networking I think it's really beautiful it's really necessary and I definitely see it as prerequisite if you want to have success also in the Cal world because you always need these experts to validate your Cal models and give you suggestions who would you like to thank I'll say starting my family with uh the support that they've given so I come from a very interesting background of a medical background where my parents my sister all of them they they are doctors so just to give me the support of uh letting me do what I wanted to do because I've always been intrigued with the data uh world since I was a kid and like you mentioned like as a 10 year old K so I'll definitely thank my parents for that but also like uh the friends and definitely I won't forget the LinkedIn Community because that has really really uh um affected me in a positive way and um U really really helped me get one of the best ideas uh whenever I've been stuck I just just I always have LinkedIn installed in my phone like I always try to read out sometimes I'll be in a club or a pub and I'll see all these interesting research paper in the Cal uh world and um always happy so just to all these uh random people on LinkedIn uh doing the good work uh I think these are the people I really want to thank you mentioned your parents what would be one or two things that they did that made you feel that they really supported you I think the first thing of course was allowing me to go into this wonderful field of data uh rather than medical which is a very uncommon thing if you are coming from a medical background in India more or less you will go into this medical field second was giving me this freedom to travel around and experience different cultures and different things like allowing me to go to Cairo or allowing me to go to Poland and wo or Lublin or now just allowing me to be in Germany so I think this was really beautiful for me and just even though they don't understand a lot of my field they're always supportive and all uh I always used to even now I have these conversations even about cajal machine learning with them because I want to understand their perspective I talk to them a lot about llm so just being willing to uh do this active listening part by the parents and then just giving genuine recommendations and suggestions as uh wonderful you also mentioned the the LinkedIn community who are the people you would recommend to follow in in machine learning con cality so there are a lot of interesting companies that I can definitely recommend to follow Kaja lens is one of them I think they they do incredible work if you go on to the website they have done some really brilliant research and also in Industries they have done some impactful work uh then of course like you uh I think you have a really good Community but also you post a lot uh and some some relevant stuff and yeah I mean just uh I'll say just connect with a lot of people from academics also because uh they'll they are the ones who will always try to uh learn the most recent thing and uh the interesting ones also are from the uh from the industries where we you'll see a different kind of use case being applied like people from Spotify or Netflix you see that okay ah okay maybe I can apply this thing and um my use case too so I'll say follow different kind of people with coming from different demographics different companies uh research um academics and and industries you mentioned academic people uh in many of my conversations there is this topic it appears somewhere uh that some people even though some of them studied things like statistics they learned about causality much much later after they've graduated they finished the study because the programs were not talking about causality even if causality was somehow um or would seem for us maybe a relevant topic within those programs do you see a change in Academia as a person who is also a supervisor now for for younger generation for students I do so starting with myself like I definitely encourage my students to read a bit more about that about about koality and this whole new world but I also like I've had a chance to work with and go to different universities Pete T Munich or LMU or MIT and I really enjoy these conversations uh with the current students or the phds or researching right now and uh caal machine learning is a big technology in their work so I think I definitely see the change coming in and it's really really exciting and I think it will only get better I think that's great news and uh I'm so happy to see the new generation having this opportunity at least in some of the universities to learn about causality during their during their studies because this is also the time when they might have a little bit more space at least some of them to go deeper into this topic if they feel interested and then when they start their career in a very different place than than than we were uh in the beginning you also mentioned your work in industry and in particular the idea of uh those different levels of analytics starting with descriptive and going to predictive and prescriptive um what are the main insights from this perspective uh when you look at your work and in the context of causality so I did wanted to compare all these three levels um and then just interview the experts of what they what they feel about different uh analytic tools with these kind of Technology the insights were really really amazing in where all of the experts they they preferred a caal approach and that's where I also formed a analytic hierarchy process again this multicriteria decision making where we also check the consistency level of these experts uh that how biased their answers are or not and interview different multiple experts in a research way so the answers you'll get will be pretty accurate and for me a few of the more interesting insights were of course uh everybody preferring a caal approach but things like explainability where experts clearly did not trusted machine learning that enough but they really trusted uh cal machine learning or things like stress test or time to recover capabilities which is super important in uh Supply Chain management C Machine learning scored really heavily on that what also I discovered is that if you combine all the different criterias on which I evaluated these Technologies it could be business it could be uh explainability time to recover stress test and all these criteria around 48% uh cal machine learning is a big winner but you leave it to around 24% for the descriptive part and then the rest to the predictive part so there is not a much uh difference between the descriptive and the uh the predictive part which could uh make you wonder that maybe if you invest a million euros as a management into this predictive part uh stakeholders are not willing to believe in that so for me what additional benefit I'm getting rather than it just being a fancy word AI did a science in then end I'm just not willing to trust it more explainability part I cannot explain it more and results clearly show showed us this thing so what according to my research I got to know is that these experts for the first time they didn't just like these results or they gladly they did not doubted it but they absolutely loved it they absolutely loved what they learned they absolutely loved uh the cal machine learning which was a uh gamechanging uh moment for me because these experts really wanted to play with the tool they uh they still play with the tool they run out uh run with all these simulations and uh come out with different uh interesting insights so that was something U amazing that I observed from from from my experiment what's next for you uh I'm still very intrigued with what llms have to offer in this world especially combining kajal AI with this Genera Ai and llm bold uh is definitely interesting and I also feel that uh the future of dashboarding is definitely having this K plus llm thing so I'm imagining I'm in a management role I'm the decision maker I go to this my my phone or my application and type out okay tell me the next player which will be uh get injured because maybe his stress level is increased of uh XYZ maybe someone from his family is affected or or maybe he met with an accident or I want to know that there's a tsunami in Miami tell me which supplier will be affected and in what way so to quantify that effect also I think that is the future and um I think I think this will come sooner than later uh later and I'm really excited about that what question would you like to ask me how would you evaluate your causal models without an without an expert so yes I answer it uh briefly but I want to know that how you can convince the management would you do some sensitivity analysis or how would you tackle this problem it's a great question um I think sensitivity analysis and and partial identification and all those like Advanced identifications strategies that allow for some types of hidden variables in the model these are um highly under represented methods in the industry and underrated um of course they also have their limitations but they allow us to expand the possible Universe of of use cases where we get valid causal inferences very significantly so that's one thing and I think what I see in when working with my clients and what I hear also from from my guests in the podcast is that iterative approach to building a model is is something that work Works in many cases maybe not all cases but many cases which means that we might build a model then compare the distribution from the model with with the observational distribution then if we are able to perform an intervention we intervene maybe on like a small subsample we generate the data from the model and do operation and we compare it and so on um if we don't have experts this this process is probably usually uh longer it just takes long more time because we need to discover what otherwise we could learn from from the experts uh but if we have expert knowledge in some kinds of documents and so on this this knowledge can also be be retrieved so we can consult the documents using KMS that you mentioned and I think one of the paths that are relatively unexplored in this area in this area of the inter ction between causality and large language models is using um retrieval augmented generation so we all know that llms can hallucinate and R so retrieval augmented generation usually reduces those hallucinations uh very very significantly and I think this is one of the paths that is also also promising um to wrap it up I think I think the Readiness to treat this as an iterative problem process and applying those iterations applying interventions and comparing this with with the model these are some interesting paths and definitely uh partial identifiability and sensitivity analysis are are also ways to go um regarding interventions there's also this very interesting Avenue called optimal experimentation Theory where you can where you can um assess what actions you should take in order to minimize the uncertainty uh in an optimal in an optimal way so there are papers like ABCI active Bas and causal inference and I know that uh some some people are working now on extensions of this with less limitations uh and finally the fourth thing is Cal data Fusion so if we have some experimental data already and we have some observational data there is a good chance that we will be able to to draw causal conclusions from from this data by combining it um and leveraging this the structural properties um of the data set so yeah I I would say that those four things although three of them are maybe maybe they are not necessarily directly about evaluation uh they can help us understand uh how good we are doing with uh with with with the model I'll ask a follow-up question on that uh about this uh the data metrics is the world we live right now is a lot of Blackstone events keep on happening and right now nothing surprises so I had an interesting conversation with few of the people from my company and we were talking about how about if there's a alien attack I want to know the effect of it on my supply chain how do how do I do it then because then even an expert won't know um what what could be the effect of or um he cannot testify or verify anything where does cality play a role there that's a great question so I think we have a couple of we can take a couple of perspectives here um one of them would be that the alien attack uh is a new variable in the system that we just haven't included because it never happened before and we just didn't know that there's a variable like this now of course aliens might impact our um might impact our supply chain directly so they just can come and maybe destroy a production line or or do something like this and I think in this sense it would be very difficult to model uh but there might be also something different so maybe this alien attack is just disturbing or or interfering with certain processes that are indirectly uh related to our supply chain now if we take into account the Mark of blanket of our process so the set of variables that we are interested in that they can impact our treatments and our outcomes uh then perhaps we can model the the the alien attack as an exogenous distribution and uh if that if this is possible our caal model can still do a a good job because we'll just propagate the distribution from for the structural causal model and and we should should still get a relevant outc comes uh in this case now one of the challenges you could say here is that this requires a very uh Rich specification of the causal model in particular we need to know the functions uh in the in the Cal model and uh if we only approximate them we can have challenges with uh things like positivity assumption and and so on and so on so we might have certain areas of the distribution that we never observe in the past Um this can be covered partially by expert knowledge but sometimes it might be challenging so alien attack might be challenging at least the first one yeah but I still feel feel yeah I mean by the explanation of your answer is that it still could be useful so it's better than just just random guessing or uh using some conventional methods to predict something and uh better utilize caj machine learning even in this unheard uh circumstances or events yeah it could be defin itely I mean it really depends where those aliens are attacking right so but I think um you know it's also about expectations um when we think about science uh maybe there's a cultural a cult a cultural cultural topic here that at some point I feel like in general in Western societies we started thinking about science as something that is absolute that just gives us uh the ultimate explanation about the world how it works and so on and I think this is a very un unscientific way to think about science uh because what we have we have hypothesis and then we in perar language we would say we are just trying to falsify them and as long we as we haven't falsified them we say like hey they still hold given all the data and all the measurement uh measurement tools that we have today uh so we say like this is a this theory has a good fit in evolutionary sense right that's that's what we could say um so causal models are not something that is like a hyp science they have all the same limitations that science has um in in a sense they are an embodiment of of a scientific of a scientific method and and so I think that it is a disservice to the community to build expectations that caal mod models are like the ultimate uh solution to anything and if we build them we just can close the door and the computer will will do everything for us uh we might get close to this to this state in certain cases business or I don't know or other um or other or other context U but I think it's it's not um it's it's it's healthy to also be aware that those methods have have limitations and now if we think about strictly predictive methods the limitations um are more severe the last question from me will be if if I ask you is do you think uh cal machine learning is better than machine learning or it's a better way of doing machine learning or the correct way of doing machine learning I don't think it's better I think I think machine learn like predictive machine learning is amazing and you know I'm here because of predictive machine learning because one day I just read about those programs that can learn from experience and I was like I want to learn this it's it's so fascinating um I think the challenge today that we are facing is the challenge of the community sometimes missing the clear distinctions a clear distinction between where which questions can be answered with predictive associative machine learning and which questions might require a causal model or another active model um and I think this is the main Challenge and um and I think realizing this uh that we have this Challenge and working on addressing it is something that can move the entire AI Community uh forward much faster thanks a lot thank you is I still have a question for you sure so you did so many things in your life uh worked in many different contexts in many different areas um you're also a cricket player some people that are starting with new things especially where there are complex things like machine learning or causality they might have a feeling that there is so much to learn that this is just overwhelming what would be your advice to those people I mean one of the reasons why I did this PhD also was um it was not just learning reading a lot of research papers but practically trying out different things and just getting your hands dirty so I know it's a lot of theoretical uh work um lot of research papers even right now in uh the caal world there are a lot of things to read um amazing books like yours and I think there are a few more so I I will say it's good to research a bit good to read a bit good to watch these kind of amazing podcast but also you should just start on applying things start on finding different use cases I think one of the good way also is to maybe try to whatever the conventional machine learning use case you would have done think it of as a caal problem and maybe see that how uh cal machine learning can be more beneficial put your entrepreneurship hat on and see that what different values you can bring out uh using Cal AI so I think just get get your hand sturdy do some research but uh at some stage just just start executing things and that's where you'll start learning more too because people will ask you questions the questions will never stop they'll ask you that how you evaluate the model what if there are Al alien attacks or what if uh this and that uh so that's where you'll start learning more you'll go to the community you'll read uh your book or you'll they'll Reach Out people to LinkedIn and trying to understand more So eventually you'll get really good at that uh but yeah learning by doing what keeps you motivated so yeah like I mentioned earlier I come from a very interesting background of where my parents are doctors my sister she's a doctor and I always see that in this world of data sence we also have this capability to create a difference in people life just just just by doing our work and uh that is something that keeps motivating me so if I'm working in a corporate I know that I can end up like making some really amazing models that can result in making the company a lot of money or maybe I can make some of the uh football clubs win championships or maybe I can predict uh that some person will have a cancer soon so these are the things that uh keep on motivating me and uh I'll I'll say that even we are kind of a fancy doctors in the end where we can predict things as early as possible and sometimes even quicker than what uh the conventional doctors will do what was the most challenging day in your career most challenging day I think the challenge is something that keeps on arriving every day especially if you live in this world of U production supply chain football clubs the challenge never never stops so I'll say the most challenging day for me always will be where I lose a bit of motivation yeah I mean every every day is different so I won't say uh what was my most challenging day I'll say uh one of the most different uh days was my transformation or the change from coming from football industry Sports industry to to automotive industry that was challenging just because of uh lack of knowledge of the domain domain knowledge so that was initially a bit overwhelming uh but yeah I think um once once you get into that you start learning more you start doing the proper networking um you you start learning more everything uh keeps keeps uh taking care of that after afterwards what help you get going during this time of transition so I think the right people uh near to me I think they really helped me I think um uh I've always been I think I've always been a good leader but I'm also a good follower and I think I've been lucky in life to have some amazing Role Models beat my supervisors so I think uh especially I'll give a shout out to my supervisor uh in BMW I think I learned a lot from him also he was my supervisor for my PhD and these are the people who motivate you because you learn from that that maybe they also come from a humble background wanting to create a difference in in this world trying to solve real life problems and it just just motivates you a bit bit bit more and these are the people you want to be in the end so yeah these are the things that really motivate me and held me in this difficult transition from uh let's say not even uh moving from a different industry but moving from different countries or changing different cities because I earlier used to live in northern Germany and then moving to South it's not always the easiest decision especially since you have a lot of friends and your family is back home so yeah just having the right people um with you what are the qualities of a good leader so I always feel a leader should always lead from the front but also he should trust his people I think one of the things that I always feel is that you end up investing a lot of time in hiring these amazing people and then you just don't either trust them enough or you don't give them the freedom to do amazing work so fun is just be have that mindset of trusting them more give them all the freedom and then magic will flow uh and I think uh always I think uh what what uh Apple said always is stuck in the mind is best ideas always have to win there should not be any hierarchy so if as a leader should be able to give positive and negative criticism uh but also be able to have this capability to take in that criticism so if in a meeting let's say a leader will say something which is not appropriate he should have given this freedom to his uh Team to say that okay maybe in this meeting you are not acting like a CEO which is also this Netflix mindset so I think these are definitely the characteristics that a leader should have where can people learn more about you and your work so I think uh you can find a lot of information about me on LinkedIn you can you can go there read a lot about me on or my work on LinkedIn but also yeah I mean just approach to me reach out to me I'm usually pretty active on uh this this LinkedIn community and uh if you happen to be in Munich feel free like shoot me a message uh and I always love networking with uh people uh amazing people diverse people it does not always have to be about cal machine learning but just just about uh the problem solving mindset or maybe some of the different experiences I had in different uh countries or it could be a talk about Poland yeah I think just just feel free to reach to me on LinkedIn beautiful thank you so much it was a great conversation it was a pleasure thanks a lot W congrats on reaching the end of this episode of the caal
