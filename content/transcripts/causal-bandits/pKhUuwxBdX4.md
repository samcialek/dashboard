welcome to Cal Bandits extra D you started Cal lens around 2017 cuz Al back then was a very Niche topic I I remember myself uh extremely Niche yeah how was it how was it how was the experience uh it felt very lonely uh we're now uh so excited to have this this community that is growing at an exponential rate but when we started it was very very lonely mhm um but from from the first day uh we felt that this is going to be big one day and we just wanted to make sure that we lay those foundations so when the time comes mhm like 2023 um and the community is growing exponentially we have we can support the community with cool success stories in the real world but it was to answer your question very Lely at the beginning it was a handful of people what made you take this route uh it was a contrarian bat a contrarian bat it was a contrarian bat is it is it related your a part of your story is related to hch fun that's right yeah so I was in in hch funs before starting calans um same um same for my co-founder Max he was also in the hon world and he's also a physicist right he's a physicist yes uh so obviously uh I'm a computer scientist comp scien yeah and at the time I remember reading an ft Financial Times article about Alpha go beating the world champion at the game of Go and everybody was getting extremely excited about deep learning at a time so everybody was pivoting all of their AI research that was deep learning they're like okay deep learning is going to solve everything mhm um and Max and I had a very contrarian view we felt deep learning is great in certain situations um and you know if it's a board game game and this fix rules then you know that's great but in the real world um we knew that that it's just learning historical patterns can get you into trouble and we've both observed this working in the hedge fund world where just using correlations um you know the the pass almost never repeats in financial uh markets mhm um so we also knew the other thing we learned from from hedge font is that the way to win big is to take a contrarian view if you do what everybody else is doing you get paid a little bit but not a lot the time when you get paid a lot is when you do something completely different from everybody else and you're right of course you need to you know you can't just be contrarian you need to be contrarian and right um luckily for us um caal AI was a contrarian bet that was right and is becoming more right by the day so it sounds like you took two things from the experience that you gained in in in the hatch font environment one was regarding the the the nature of the patterns that's right and the lesson that in the real world the pattern might change rapidly and learing the the future is is is not necessarily predictive of the p is not necessarily predictive of the future and the second one was regarding taking bad on something so so this is a lesson from that's right those are the two two key lessons yeah that's right oh that's very interesting um what made you go into causality from the point of view of of your in the context of your career so you you studied computer science that's right yeah so when I was doing my PhD was in computer vision it was um uh in Biometrics recognizing things at at at a distance with with cameras and things like that and we we had tried many many approaches there uh we tried deep learning we tried model based approaches what we learned was that in the lab deep learning worked really well because the background was the same um everything was the same so just throwing a lot the more the more data we through the better the Deep learning became mhm now soon as we took out the Deep learning in the real world it all broke down and we were trying to understand you know how can this be like we have incredible performance in the lab soon as we take it out in the real world it just breaks down like catastrophically it's not like small deteriation of performance it just broke down mhm so then we decided to try something else we decided to take a model based approach to learning so I say you can learn the uh the features of the human body how the the Torso moves how the arms move how the legs move or if you're doing face recognition uh you can learn kind of a 3D shape uh of the head and you can say well the eyes have to like belong in this part of the model they can't be you know where the ears are and so on and we realized that the model base approach had slightly worse performance in the lab mhm but when we took it out in the real world it retained it performance um so that was theing it was generalizing so much better uh that it was just not not comparable and that's really the other motivation for for me for cality is that if you don't have a model and if you don't really understand the cause and effect mechanisms uh you can do really well in the lab but you're not going to do really well in the real world and I think we've seen that in the Enterprise today about 85 to 90% depending on which statistic you read of the projects never make it outside the lab mhm and this is fundamentally the reason for it is that you get incredible results in the lab but soon as you take them out in the field they either fail to deliver or the humans that are going to use those algorithms and those applications do not trust it because they don't understand what is the causal model behind it or what is the model behind it mhm and so I think to be able to take AI from the lab to the real world we need to solve two things we need to solve one you know can will this thing work in the real world and second will the humans using it uh trust it and we'll understand how it works so those are the two fundamental things that causality helps us [Music] achieve when you look at your clients your customers what are the main use cases where people apply coal models and when they give you feedback what aspects of those Co coal models focus on what is important to Absolutely I'll give you a concrete example with one of our most recent clients um it's a really cool use case um it's it's around uh modeling a physical system so think of it as a could be a manufacturing process could be uh a um a device that fits into into a machine something that has a true uh true reality to it like a you know a cause and effect mechanism in the real world so if you think of like a manufacturing uh line there is a cause and effect transmission because there's like real Parts connected to real Parts you know maybe you have some sort of coke here another Coke here that maybe a a kind of a chain that connects the two so there is like a real world causal link between one part of the process to another part there's like a chain that connects them it's like truly yeah TR truly causal right this thing causes this other thing there's no question about it so what they did is they um they tried to solve this problem themselves with deep learning first mhm they threw a lot of data at a problem they kept doing it and it worked really well in the lab mhm but soon as they took it out it just failed catastrophically because you know the real world was different from from the data they had collected um in the in the lab then they tried to work with six companies uh that do deep learning they thought okay maybe it's us maybe we don't know how to fit a model let's let's try with get external help they went through six companies they got to a point where they improved the performance but their senior leadership did not understand how this thing works and they were not able to explain like the real world connectivity in this machine right there's like this Cog moving here causes this other Cog to move here they're not able to explain it so they decided to abandon AI altogether they're like this not going to ever going to work um and so one of their data scientist came across um causality and came across caal Ai and us and they decided to give it one last chance uh we started doing causal Discovery so automated caal discovery on the data mhm we discovered essentially kind of a digital twin of the machine mhm um and then we were able to say let's now give this proposed causal diagram to your domain experts so people that really understand the ins and out of this machine mhm the humans looked at this causal diagram and said it's mostly right there are few things that are not quite right mhm this cck here is not really connected to this cck here therefore there's not really a causal relationship but because we never had a fault in this part of the machine your algorithm hasn't detected a causal link mhm so they were able to actually insert that coal link uh themselves so your caal Discovery process is isn't iterative process where where humans are also involed that's right humans are actually there before the models even get built and that's fundamentally different from from Deep learning and generative AI where you just throw a lot of data and you have a model and then you know good luck kind of thing whereas here we have the human involved from the very beginning how many steps do you usually um plan in a process like this so you start with expert knowledge uh then you push this expert knowledge to the to the algorithm then the algorithm or algorithms as I suppose return uh some results and then you again consult the the experts is is is that usually two or three rounds doesn't take too long um and then you know we build the the causal model when you were a child yeah was there anything any thoughts or any ideas that you could connect to what you're doing today yeah good question I think the uh there was definitely I wasn't thinking too much about uh caal AI when I was a child but I was very passionate about doing things uh building stuff in general that have a very positive that have a positive impact so my my first uh entrepreneurial venture was when I was maybe six or seven I guess first or second year at school uh my cousin was at uh doing electronics at University and and he had he was building this device that had like an ultrasound that was supposedly chasing mosquitoes MH and this particular summer uh was pretty bad with mosquitoes um so I decided to to to learn how to do soldering and just build a bunch of these devices um and so then so he gave you like a blueprint was the exactly he gave me the blueprint so I didn't invent the device but he had all the parts I was like how can I get 20 x the parts so I can build 20 of this and he's like I don't know I mean I can bring it bring you some transistors and resistors and uh and these from the lab and you can build if you like but why why do you want to do that I was like well you know everybody at school was complaining about insect bites so maybe I could build something to help them mhm um and maybe you know I can increase my pocket money in the same time so I built 20 of these things and I took them to uh well actually I built one first you know an MVP to test the market um I went to school and I was able to sell it in the first 10 minutes of showing it um so I decided to you know and there was everybody was like wanted to see it so I thought okay uh I took some pre-orders and decided to build 20 for the whole class um and my entrepreneurial lesson there from this experiment was that um you need to also worry about uh payment terms and and you know discuss those things uh before uh giving the the the product away uh so I ended up with you know substantial uh substantial lack of uh of payment uh but doesn't matter the whole class now had less in in insect bites so it was still worthwhile trying but I did learn a lesson there that you know Building Product is important but having making sure that there's a way to get paid for it is is equally important what was your next step after that yeah so after that I I I got hooked I was like this is so cool you can like sit at home build something that people want you can go then and help people have a better life um so that that you know one um one example there just inspired me and I was just wondering like how can I now do this at scale so since I was a 6 or seven uh I was just looking for the way to make an impact and obviously you know I was growing up at the time when the internet became a thing um and and programming became a thing so I remember I still didn't have a computer it was maybe 1995 or something like that um one of my one of my cousin's friends um uh was working for a for a US company uh coding and um and I was like okay what is this thing coding and so he said look I can just give you my book and all you need to do is is learn this book and obviously he was massively simplifying it for a for a young child but it's like if you learn this book it's going to open up a whole new world uh of software that is going to Change the World um so effectively I think uh that was kind of the inspiration to go into software so I spent a whole summer learning um Pascal and uh and delie and I was like wow this is actually so much faster than building uh and soldering stuff once you build one of these things you can multipied by infinite amount so I found I thought this is the vehicle to really make an impact on the World software D you mentioned your your your cousin it seems like he was an important person in your life very very important yeah it just highlights um the the role of Role Models uh when you're in your formative years of of childhood just being um surrounded by someone that was building electronics and and software was was you know truly change uh the direction for me uh for life it was really uh really formative what would be your advice to people who are starting with something maybe people who are just starting with causality and then they might feel a little bit overwhelmed with all the tooling all the terminology yeah uh and and they might feel a little bit unsure if they can really make it what would be your advice to them first of all you should be uh confident that you will definitely make it um coal AI is now actually accessible um we have books we have open source packages it's in a so much better State than we started a company with Max in 2017 so uh first I would say read the book read the book of why it's incredibly important from a from a foundational um um from a foundational perspective so kind of the theory uh to learn the causal Theory and that will help you understand all of the buzzword and causality that one book read it twice if necessary but that book will be will be really mative for you um then the second thing you can do is uh play around uh with open source tooling there's loads of cool stuff coming out um new new open source uh causal packages are popping up and there's really great examples um we hope to help the community in the future by open sourcing some of our cool algorithms uh we also hope to make our uh Enterprise platform uh free um you know either Community version or free to try which will make that Journey even easier and we're working very hard to make that uh happen kind of unifying uh the interfaces so using similar calls for all the algorithms from from all the different um uh kind of creators uh but there's yeah just the book of why and the open source stuff that is currently available and you have great blogs as well um thank you so read Alex's Vlogs uh that's really really uh really cool as well um but I think we know we we also will prepare a lot more um for the data science Community um come to our conference we're organizing the caal AI conference it's a community event uh we do it for the community you know we don't do any selling no marketing um and next year we we will be you know somewhere in the US or the UK we'll see um but please come to that that will be also a great opportunity to learn about how to get started dark some people say that uh that generative AI is the future uh we repeatedly said today in the conversation that we that that you believe I share this belief with you uh that caal AI or causal thinking is is is also something that will play important role in development of intelligence systems decision- making systems in the future uh what are your thoughts about when you look at those both ideas Genera ideas and and causal ideas how do you see them developing further in the future gen is amazing for certain things and coal AI is really amazing with other things so the the point is that when you combine this Technologies together 1 + 1 equals 3 and we therefore see a huge uh potential and quite un exploited potential actually to combine these two technologies uh together and we will need um other building blocks as well I think gen and coal AI are great building blocks but we'll need few more um and we might not know what exactly those are today what what would be your guesses regarding those buildings what what what what what might we be missing today yeah that's a question I think a lot about but I don't think if I'm entirely honest I don't think I have uh the answer um because the way I think about you know we don't fully understand um you know it's it's the unknown unknowns I guess and we will need to write a new Theory it's kind of how we wrote the causal AI Theory and I think we'll be at at a at the moment in the future again where we'll need we we realize that geni and coal AI put together is it is three but we need few more points to get to to AGI and I think we we first need to take this first step of combining these two technologies and realizing where there is a gap I think we just have to do that hard work and research to figure that out before we realize that there's a gap and my God feel is there will be still a gap that we then need to come out with new Theory new research to fill that Gap but just to be clear I think just using Co and and jna we can get so far there's a lack of harmonization of the packages uh so we we think that an interface that will unify say all of the causal Discovery packages working in the same way all the causal modeling packages working the same way all the decision intelligent engines working a similar way I think that's a big gap and it's it's natural part of the evolution but we need to get there we need to be like esala and we need to have the equivalent of of causal packages to do that we we are missing what you're saying is that we are missing the unification that skar offers to the community that's a big gap for us and uh we actually will help the community by open sourcing our interfaces to help achieve this and we hope that the community will adopt this to help us unify and be you know you know for us to have a serious chance at at adoption we need to do this D it was a pleasure let's have some natas I'm ready to celebrate our conversation look at this beauty [Music] yeah
