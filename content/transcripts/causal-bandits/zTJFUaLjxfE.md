but when I read book of why that sort of changed things for me science is the amalgamation of theories that have survived rigorous falsification you know sometimes you do want to stop you do want to be derailed because you really are headed in a wrong direction One common theme that I've had in my life is certain times in my life I thought I was amazing at something whatever it is and turns out I'm really bad at it and that uh kind of woke me up I won't stop until hey caal Bandits welcome to the caal bandits podcast the best podcast on causality and machine learning on the internet today we're traveling back to Los Angeles to meet our guest during his high school years he was a pretty damn good tennis player but his love for computers was stronger than his love of tennis after college he rejected an offer from a big tech company to join a startup later on he founded a successful business but he quitted to devote his full attention to studying causality ladies and Gentlemen please welcome Mr Scott Muller let me pass it to your host Alex molak welcome to the podcast Scott thank you how are you today I'm good how are you very good the weather is sweet today conr Lawrence um who is considered the founding father of ethology looking and examining animal behavior Behavior once said that thinking is acting is in imaginary space majority of your current work is work about contactual thinking soal rank three of bur and Ladder of of cation when you think about this quote and your work what are your thoughts oh it's a great quote I Heard It For the First Time recently uh in Bernard skull cops uh Kino presentation at clear I love it because on one hand the quote speaks to how we estimate counterfactual probabilities and estimand because we are uh imagining hypothetical worlds and we're we're building causal models for those worlds of course we can't really experience those worlds run experiments in those worlds act in those worlds but we can estimate things that are happening in those worlds based on what's happening in our world so uh so from that perspective it's a great quote but also the the more philosophical or metaphysical ideas behind it of uh when we think about something we are running that through in our minds in a uh in in in this imagined space that we uh were performing those actions no matter how how strange or outside of reality those those scenarios are in a way sort of bridges you know the the causal models that uh that I think about frequently for counterfactual reasoning and our everyday thoughts MH how we think about things what are the main challenges that you face in your work today my work today is is um the the direction of my research is on being able to make better decisions as at an individual level uh but also at at the level of having policies that are effective uh for a large population uh but making better decisions based on counterfactual reasoning and you know counterfactual reasoning hits upon this fundamental problem of causal inference where we can't observe the outcomes for two different treatments and so we can't somebody take a medicine and then go back in time and then have them not take the medicine and see what's happening at an individual level we can't do that of course we can't do that really at a population level but it's but we can estimate that uh pretty in a pretty straightforward way at a population level and get those averages the problem with this fundamental problem with of causal inference is that makes it difficult to to get to uh get Point estimates or identify these these uh probabilities a while ago uh Jin Tian and Judea Pearl uh came up with these bounds on probabilities of causation particular counterfactual probabilities that are that are interesting probability of necessity probability of sufficiency and the probability of necessity and sufficiency and there's some others that are that are pretty interesting as well those bounds um they even though they were proven tight meaning we can't do any better than those bounds mathematically we can never do any better without further assumptions those bounds are often too loose mhm to base uh some decisions off of too loose to be useful and uh and so the challenge is how do we narrow those bounds ideally we narrow them so much they become identified or point identified but at least if we can narrow them down sometimes uh to a sufficient degree that allows us to uh to understand underlying data generating processes better or or make better decisions and so so that's the challenge um now I can't do any better than than what they've done U they've proven that but we can we can think about what assumptions what additional assumptions we can make that would allow us to identify these counterfactual probabilities or or narrow those bounds significantly and so you know there are a lot of assumptions you can make to do that uh but which assumptions are most reasonable and which assumptions um make sense for a particular scenario in one of your papers you have shown that if we can afford to make So-Cal the monotonicity Assumption this can be very helpful can you share with our audience what this assumption is basically uh monotonicity says that that there's no possibility of harm and and harm in the counterfactual sense so as as a concrete example or semic concrete example you uh you can take some medicine and hopefully you get better from your illness harm would be that if you take the medicine that some toxic element of the medicine prevents you from getting better but if you had not taken the medicine you would have gotten better on your own your own immune system would have taken care of the the illness so negative counterfactual effect yes at an individual level at an individual level right right and and if that is if the probability of that happening is zero if that's not possible then and in for certain scenarios that that just definitionally isn't impossible for other scenarios we may know the underlying biological mechanisms of this medicine and we know that this this can't happen then we have monotonicity and once you have monotonicity you can do a lot of other things um particularly there you can now you can point identify probability of benefit probability of harm or probability of harm is zero but other counterfactual probabilities of that nature probability of necessity probability of sufficiency what is the main challenge you think that causes those methods not to be applied in practice more broadly today the methods of uh assuming monity and then identifying these yeah identifying counterfactual quantities yeah well I I think so um so for one uh how do you know you have mon maybe you don't have monotonicity MH and and so assuming that would be a problem because uh you're you're going to get skewed results number two maybe you do have monity but how do you know uh so um and and this is the subject of of a paper I'm working on now um I presented it at uh Rand Institute held of the conference so I I I presented U part of that paper but I'm I've been improving that paper and and almost done with it along with uh Judea Pearl uh and and we show how um how you sometimes you can from the data show that you do have monotonicity that's pretty rare to be able to show that you do have monotonicity from the data alone uh but what is much more feasible is sometimes you can show from the data that you definitely do not have monotonicity mhm so there is a relatively good test yes that we can use in order to say for sure we don't have monotonicity and there's a weaker test that can tell us that we have monotonicity but it's only in a saet of conditions yes yeah so so it's uh in in in very particular situations that it'll be pretty rare to apply uh you can confirm that you have an honesty but disproving it is is certainly a lot easier as as we all know in general disproving things in uh in science is uh is far easier and then further you know we say okay maybe uh you don't have monotonicity but but how much is it violated and so we write about how what are the limits to monotonicity in your particular situation and then even though we might not be able to identify the counterfactual probabilities we can narrow those bounds further because we know there's a limit to the to the violation of monotonicity mhm so this like putting a bound on the bound yeah yeah yeah is that correct yes uh putting a bound on monotonously which puts a bound on the probability yes yeah yes yeah I always I always love you know all those ideas all those creative ideas that we produce in in in in the causal Community U because here we are dealing with with we are basically on the verge of human knowledge in a sense yeah and everything that we can apply to I want to say verify but actually I should say falsify those models is the same set of tools that we have in science in general so in this sense causality or causal modeling could be nicknamed scientific modeling and it's I agree it's basically the same thing yeah I mean so of and in science we're asking that question of what caused this and what are we looking at what are the consequences of this what are the effects the effects of the causes and the causes of the effects there's another quote that you shared with me before we met for for the recording today that comes from uh Marcos Lopez de PR who works in finance would you like to share this quote as well uh yeah so well so I read it in his book The causal Factor investing book I think he quoted it from somebody else um I I don't know who the original I didn't pay attention to who the original uh author of that quote was but uh um it's that science is the amalgamation of theories that have survived rigorous falsification yeah I I love that um we we had a discussion about it before but I love the Simplicity of that statement what science boils down to and you know when you think how amazing the world is we live in now because of all of the scientific advancements so many great people before us uh came up with throughout throughout the centuries and in modern times it just is accelerating it's just amazing and and so where is all this knowledge coming from how do we know it's really true and and we think oh well you know there's been all these experiments and we've we've you know mathematically shown various things to be the case and and we've proven this and not proven that and and all that but but really it's very very hard in science to prove things it's much easier to disprove things and so our knowledge mostly is is is uh based on all of these theories that we've come up with that we've tried to disprove but they have survived and if they have survived all that uh all the attention to try to disprove them then uh we are confident raises on what's what's really going on in the universe it's really great um this this aspect of survival also brings to my mind you know this evolutionary dynamics that we have in science and when when I was listening to you now I just uh recalled one of my conversations with with with a person that applies cality in practice and when I was talking with them about model evaluation you know they told me like hey we start with something you know then we check the the consequences of of this model you know like predictions of this model against reality maybe we do some intervention we see if the model is generating the data that is similar to what we get from the intervention and so this is also this this iterative process is basically an evolutionary process and I heard very similar things from other practitioners and I also use the same approach like an itative approach in in work with my my clients what do you think we could do in order to make your findings from your work more accessible to practitioners today yeah yeah great question uh because um that's ultimately what I what I hope I hope that I'm able to contribute value to people and uh and if I just write papers that nobody reads then and that's not then I haven't really done anything even if I uh I I'm lucky enough to to have some valuable content there or some valuable discoveries I know at least three people who who are reading your papers okay yeah that's great but I think that's a just a very small subset of people who are reading your papers you know I'm uh I'm I'm eager to provide value um to uh to to this amazing world that that we are we are living in in in modern times any which way I can I'm I'm uh I'm excited about that uh so first I have to actually do something valuable and uh and then I have to uh have people actually uh use it and and and benefit from it so aside from publishing and and and going to conferences and speaking and and and that kind of thing um there's uh my background is actually software Dev Vel m in computer science so I hope to to develop uh some applications and uh and and software Frameworks contribute to uh projects like do why uh which I've recently talked with thanks to you um recently talked with some of the some of the folks over there um I'll be uh I'll be adding to their open source Library some of the uh some of the theorems and formulas that I've I've come up with that's really great to hear um I'm super excited about this and I think there's a lot of great theoretical work in causality and I think that's a great opportunity today to start translating this this uh work into convenient um software packages that people can easily easily use y so something you know that has an API that looks familiar like I think DUI is doing an excellent job with this uh using using a very similar approach to what psychic learn does for for General machine learning building like a consistent API for different uh different models different approaches and so on and so on so that makes it easier for people who don't necessarily have time to implement something from scratch right or to go through I don't know 10 different libraries um it makes it easier for them to apply this and it increases the probability that they can actually make this stuff running in production I think yeah so so that's part of it um that would be uh that would be amazing if uh and and I know some other I know that's a popular project and I think it's growing in popularity and I think you're right that that Dy may be the psyit learn of uh causal inference and so that benefits software developers uh it's a python framework uh but I also hope that uh some software developers will use that as a base for for even more General approaches to things so maybe you know building a nice gooey on top of it where you you know you can be an expert in a particular field in in econometrics or biology or or or something else and you don't need to be an expert in software development or in in um some aspects of causal inference yet still uh make use of this at an even higher level what you mean is like building interfaces that are accessible to people who maybe don't necessarily code but they have domain expertise that they can they could use so the interfaces could be you know drag and drop uh you know click here and and and that kind of thing or it could be um an integration into an existing I don't know too much about econometrics or or some of the other fields uh that that maybe maybe epidemiologists I don't do epidemiologist have this nice software package that allows them to model things um but maybe it's an integration if they do maybe it's an integration into some you know popular software package so so they get they sort of get it for free yeah I think you know there are many different fields I mean we have people in marketing yeah marketing is vividly interested in causal inference and not all of them have expertise to to code themselves right so so so marketing I I did a lot of internet marketing when I was doing internet businesses and you know I had um I was not a marketing expert um and I worked with some marketing experts um and I tried to learn um and one one popular thing that pretty much every internet marketing software package has and and even built into something like Google AdWords um is AB testing you know some of the work that that I've done and and uh some of the work uh that other colleagues of mine have done uh Angley is uh did this you he started this uh this great framework for unit selection is is really valuable to marketers and and it becomes clear that AB testing the way the there's a huge industry around where you have multiple different kinds of ads that can go out to the same target audience and and it can you know split randomly who gets to see which ad and then from there you get to understand as the campaign is running which is better performing on average um that can be severely optimal and this is a a core thing that's built into so many marketing platforms um but it but with something like DUI and with some of the uh some of the work that that myself and other colleagues have uh have have worked on if that can be integrated into these marketing platforms you know they can sort of get get a lot of this for free maybe they can specify you know so so the unit selection framework is is such that you may specify certain extra attributes that you don't need to specify with AB testing is the value to you of advertising to somebody who will respond favorably to your ad what is the negative value to you for advertising to somebody who would who would be sort of harmed by the ad in the sense that they will not buy your product if they see your ad but they would buy your product if they don't see your ad and so um so you know you might have to update the interface a little bit but but essentially you get a lot of this counterfactual reasoning you can uh for for low cost low cost cognitively Scott for those people in our audience who are not familiar with the unit selection framework could you give us a short definition the unit selection framework was was created by Angley and Juda Pearl Angley was a PhD student of of Judas and is now a professor of Florida State University and and he wrote this great um paper on unit selection that allows you to uh to specify the weight or value you would place on four different types of of responders and we can talk about this in terms of um a marketing example and so the treatment is that you show somebody an ad and the uh the response is they buy your product and so the four different responders are first a complier that means that if you show them an ad they will buy the product how ever that same person if you don't show them the ad they will not buy your product and then there's the always taker who will buy your product whether or not you show them the ad never taker they will not buy your product whether or not you show them the ad and then there's the one you really don't want to adverti to which is the defier and if you don't show them the ad they're going to buy your product because they need it or because they they want it and uh and and they know about it uh but if you show them your ad they are not going to buy your product maybe the ad is offensive to them or maybe it reminds them of something and uh maybe it it it allows them to think about it more and wonder if there's a better option for whatever reason uh the defier is is the one that that you will turn away from showing the ad so you have these four responders four response types and you place a value on each one clearly you want to advertise to the compliers uh those are the ones that will be effective for your advertisement and uh and and although the never takers and the always takers it's okay to advertise to them because it doesn't really matter whether or not you advertise to them in general I mean it may and and this is a separate you know this is sort of some of the extensions to this framework that that I and Angley and others have come up with in general it doesn't matter but it might matter a little bit because the advertisement costs money uh maybe there's a a fee for each email sent out or maybe there's a physical package you send as part of the promotion maybe it's a discount and so they would have a negative uh value or at at best is zero value typically and then the defier might have a pretty strong negative value yeah the defier might have a more negative value than a complier has a positive value and there's where the nuances of your particular scenario or your particular business come into play you know how much do you value value these and how does that play into your strategy what he showed and and and what um we would later write papers together on and and and individually is that the typical way for advertising as you know continuing on this example the typical way that we know how to advertise better is through AB testing you know what messages work and don't work we sent out two messages or two advertisements or two packages whatever the advertisement is to the same group but we randomly pick who gets which treatment yeah um you know it might not be two it might be five or 10 or whatever and um so we send out multiple advertisements and from there it's sort of like an a randomized control trial and so we can see who's getting better and there's optimization techniques for okay but in this particular batch that of advertisements and and this Target demographic or Target web pages or emails or or physical addresses you want to send out most of the advertisements of the one that has shown to be on average uh most conducive to sales or product sold but that can be severely suboptimal for your particular scenario or business or strategy and and that's shown in in these papers um using this this approach to unit selection and and it's pretty easy to apply the unit selection even though it's based on counterfactual reason and counterfactual probabilities these response types they're all individual level treatment effects and we know that you know you can't identify those but if you plug in observational data and hopefully uh that combined experimental data Maybe you only have OB uh experimental data so you plug you know you can plug in only experimental data too we can give you bounds on these uh the the overall value so you know maybe advertising to this particular set of units or or subpopulation gives you a value of uh between negative $20 and positive $20 and it's like okay well you know I don't know but but advertising to this other sub population gives you a um a value of between $30 and $35 positive so that's good so choose the second one that's sufficient to make a better decision yes Scott you started with computer science then you moved to business and then you decided to go and study causal inference what's the unifying threat or unifying perspective of for you all o over all of those years and those experiences great question and I certainly didn't have a a unifying strategy in my mind of how my life was going to unfold from College on um in college I studied computer science at as an undergraduate uh also as for my masters and PhD but that that that came later uh but at that time um I finished with a bachelor's degree in computer science and uh and I loved it I loved computer science um I loved the mathematical nature of it of course as you're learning computer science in college there is some programming that you learn as well and I love the programming I love creating things and you know when I graduated there was a thought in my mind of should I stay and get a master's degree or or or or or PhD or or um something in Academia or uh go in into the workforce and uh and for me um the tech world was really exciting I had friends that were doing very well in the tech world and they were convincing me to join them in various companies or start new things and uh and so that thought of staying in school was very had very very low preference or priority um so I uh I went into the tech world as a software developer and uh and and those were really exciting times for me you know the the prospect of of a lot of people using my software of of of making a lot of money of of doing important things all that the whole excitement of the industry was uh intoxicating for me eventually I wanted to start my own companies and uh one in particular which led to a series of other startups that I that I founded or co-founded or or or joined very early on so that brought me from software development into more of a of a business type mindset and less less actual Hands-On software development though I never quite lost that I love it I love software development even to this day I do very little software development now really a small amount but but to me that's that's fun uh I I have uh I I was a TA for a professor um and a really phenomenal professor at UCLA and and he still does software development and he talks about it as a therapeutic for him and and I can completely see that you know for me if you know there's an option Saturday night go out to the movies or or hang out with friends or go to the yeah go to the beach during the day or whatever or sit in my room and and develop software room developing software is a lot more fun um so even in California yeah yeah wherever right California has great beaches and all that but that uh that pales in comparison in my mind yeah to uh to the fun that can be had creating creating something that never existed before through uh through code so then I I I started a company that first company ended up not working out uh but I have just great memories of it um we raised we raised some money from it for it uh we built it up to 50 employees about um at at its peak uh and then at the end uh had to let let them go Parts at a time until we had none left but uh you know then and then I went through a series of companies um but even even the failures of course the successes were were really really fun um you know now making actual money and uh and and and that was the money of course is exciting because you know you I want to buy I want to have a life that uh that I don't have to worry about money number one but uh also have have the luxuries and of of of life that money entails and here I'm starting to do that and so that's that's really exciting but even the failures um I I just have really great memories of of you know trying to build something great with with people that you become very close with um that whole experience was wonderful maybe in my mind maybe my brain is not uh remembering the bad times so much are placing placing low emphasis on that and so I I only remember um mostly the uh the good times all along you know I do I I always had this uh this this sort of deep hidden uh desire to go back to school because I think you know even as exciting as Tech was the tech business the tech world uh and even as much as I enjoyed kind of the Practical nature of software software development in my mind I felt like my brain is is less well suited for that and more well suited for for the kind of more mathematical academic uh type of uh thinking that that's part of computer science I think I always had this this this uh desire sort of nagging at me uh to go back to school and and while I was at my previous company prior to going back to school uh U code I loved it um I was teaching we were teaching that me that the company that I created was was formed to teach kids uh computer science and and you know we had the opportunity for some kids to go really really deep in the computer science and uh and I loved it uh many levels while I was there still around today but while I was there we taught over 10,000 kids um and we made some pretty big impacts on their lives um so that that was a very fulfilling company in many ways uh but at the same time while I was at that company AI had really started to uh to have an impact in the world it impact on companies U people started to become much more interested in it because it was it was showing it was it was becoming obvious how how useful it was and and for me that was super exciting because you know of the dream to get to artificial general intelligence the super intelligence the human level AI um that to me was that's going to change the world even if if we can get close to that clone a trillion copies I mean there are practical limitations um and so you know that's not necessarily going to be the case but but you can imagine clone a trillion copies of this Almost Human uh AI in some ways far surpassing human capabilities in some ways not quite there but uh but close and then hey you guys you trillion AI uh AI people agents uh go work on cancer or go work on this particular problem we have in the world and and solve it and uh and so those dreams those ideas were were were too much for me to not uh not want to do something about not want to be part of not want to hopefully contribute to and and so there it became okay you know I always thought about going back to school I always felt like one day I need to get my you know PhD or at least at least master's degree and and you know and I think my brain is is better suited to that even though I had some success in in Tech um and even though I did you know the Practical software development was fun for me I still uh felt like um I belong maybe more in uh in an academic environment or research environment and so uh so I I went back to school um I for AI but during the process actually when I was applying to schools applying to graduate programs I um I came across book of why I bought I went on Amazon and I thought okay I don't you know AI is super exciting and the the ideas of what AI could do you know I was constantly dreaming about that and thinking about it but I didn't know the uh I didn't know how to uh how to contribute to it or or even contribute to it even way before that I I didn't even know uh I knew I I'd gone through the tensorflow tutorial online not a whole lot beyond that so I I didn't know um the details at all so I bought I went on Amazon I bought a ton of books on everything really Rel ated to AI at a very high level and some you know at a deeper level and my plan was just go deeper and deeper and uh and figure out where my expertise where I want my expertise to be headed towards uh but as part of that one of the books that I bought was a book of Y uh by Judea Pearl and that really caught my attention I started reading that uh all right I bought the book uh I think uh I I had been accepted to the USC and I was en I I had committed I had you know paid the deposit or whatever and um for the first classes had not started yet though this was just postco so um so there was some you know uh figuring out of how they're going to do the classes online and and that kind of thing anyway um but but when I read a book of why that that sort of changed things for me I I just thought this will go back to a common you as of a common theme of of software development business and uh and and going back to school one common theme that I've had in my life is certain things certain times in my life I thought I was amazing at something whatever it is and turns out I'm really bad at it and and that uh kind of woke me up and and in various times in my life and and made me think well wow I this is this is uh this is a surprise um here I was with an ego about about this particular thing and that was a totally unwarranted confidence that I had um and and and my life would change around that and here was an instance where I thought I was good at you know sort of the business statistics uh you know the the high level statistics looking at data and coming to some good conclusions about it interpreting it uh well and I read book of why and I just realized I am really uh novice at that and and and there's no question I have made poor decisions in the past Based on data when I thought I had made great decisions that was sort of not only surprising to me and and made me think this is something I cannot go further in my life without without knowing better um but also I felt that this this was uh sort of fundamental to human human reasoning human thinking uh thinking causally thinking counterfactually and uh and you know and we know uh that that even as babies uh there have been experiments on this I think uh Daniel conman wrote and thinking fast and slow these experiments with these toddlers you know you remove a brick or a block uh at the bottom um they expect it to fall but you remove a block but the other blocks have been glued together um and they don't FL uh they don't fall the baby's recognizes surprised yeah yeah and if we want to get to human level AI to me in my mind this was this was a core thing that we had to uh bake in to our to our machine learning models or architectures what do you think we are missing the most today in in the approach to to modeling in order to move you know move forward towards this vision of you said like generally intelligent agents yeah yeah AGI super intelligence all um the the uh the the much smarter AIS than we have today uh to solve uh really significant problems I don't want to say too much because I I my my focus has been now on on causality and causal inference um not on AI so I'm although i' I I've certainly played with chat GPT and and llms and and various other machine learning architectures and AI models um symbolic to uh but just played with them um so you know I know there are some people that think that we just need to increase uh increase the size of these models the number of parameters and you know and some you know architectural tweaks and we will get there that these properties will emerge that causality will emerge and I haven't seen that uh but you what do I know maybe maybe that will happen I know the idea of predicting the next word uh although that sounds very primitive and basic uh the idea is well we're taking the whole universe into account and so you know eventually these models will take it the whole universe into account in such a way that there's very powerful reason seasoning going on I haven't seen any of that uh yet uh my my feeling is still that that causality the the the the mathematics and the science behind causality that that we is you know humans throughout the this century and and even uh previous centuries that have done work on this um that needs to be baked in to the uh to these architectures um that was my thought uh very early getting into causality that thought remains until I've until I I see otherwise I'm pretty excited about going that direction um you know right now I have not I've been developing or trying to develop my expertise in causal inference and then uh the hope is that I can apply that to to these architectures I know some work is already going on in that in that vein what are you working on currently now the general direction of my research is on better decision- making personalized decision- making policy based decisionmaking any any kind of decision making um because that fundamentally it has to do with these counterfactual estimates counterfactual probabilities reasoning and uh and um the problem with these this counterfactual reasoning is hits at that fundamental problem cause elence that we cannot observe different outcomes for different treatments at the individual level uh we can't give you medicine and then you're see if you're you get better from your illness go back in time not give you the medicine and see what happens uh we can do that at a population level at an average we can estimate that we can do these randomized cical trials or control trials um we can do that kind of thing but we uh but because of this fundamental problem of causal interest often we cannot identify these counterfactual estimates of problem and uh and because that we're limited on some of the decision- making we uh would could do that would be more optimal than than we can do without it and so uh so a lot of my research is figuring out how can we identify these counterfactual probabilities and if we can't identify it how can we get bounds that are narrow enough for us to make uh good decisions out Scot what are one or two things that you learned while running your your business or your businesses that help you today when you work with causality and you think about causality yeah so I uh I can't say that there was anything I learned in business that applies directly to you know coming up with theorems or for mathematical formula for computing counterfactual probabilities anything like that but uh but what I can say is that there were many decisions uh some of which were important in business and I thought I had made very good decisions based on the information that was available to me at that time it was the exciting thing for me when I read uh exciting and and disheartening in in some way when I read book of Y that I realized that um I was not interpreting data always properly that I was not that that there's no way I always made good decisions based on that data on the data that I had or the information that I had of the scenario and so now when I when I think about counterfactual probabilities in particular where uh where I'm trying to come up with reasonable assumptions that somebody could make about a scenario that would allow me to narrow the bounds on probabilities of causation or identify counterfactual probabilities I think a some sense of what a reasonable assumption is I can look at some scenario and think oh yeah that assumption I could make in certain certain situations in business and wow that would have really helped or I could have made a a great you know I I could have made a great assessment analysis of the situation and and done things take taken actions Mak made decisions that that would have really benefited uh the business um so there's a bit of a you know motivation excitement in in that um but also hopefully some value that that gives me in in coming up with assumptions that are more useful to others who who would you like to thank well you know I I think I've been very fortunate in my life that there have been many people um that have had a huge positive influence on my life that have really just uh given me so much value so I'm going to limit this to not including any of my uh family um because I I'll be here for a while and and bore you and bore anybody listening um and to just people that have maybe two people that are coming to my mind right now um that have have been just a huge Mentor role model positive influence on on my education um and my uh the development of of of my growing uh expertise number one of course is Judea Pearl my PhD adviser um I uh I cannot believe even right now how lucky I am that uh that I know him that I get to work with him that uh that he is a mentor to me I feel like uh like Judea is going to go down in history as one of the great minds at the level of Isaac Newton Albert Einstein I think already I he's he's certainly in in some circles people have that level of of respect and reverence towards him uh but I think that'll grow as as some of the foundational things that he's uh he's done in his life scientifically um become a bigger and bigger part of of the future of of Science and and and especially AI but uh but aside from that um you know he's just such an amazing human being uh everything that he has gone through in his life and and and you know every phone call every visit every meeting that I have with him it is not just uh learning you know some of that incredible thinking and knowledge that he has it's uh and you've got to know him a tiny bit um he's an extremely entertaining individual I there are a lot of things I want to say right now but I feel like I'm I'm going to uh I'm going to bore you and others uh by extending this this uh to be quite lengthy he's just an incredible human being and and and so I absolutely uh cannot thank him enough for for the time he has given me there's one other guy uh clouse shaer he was a uh computer science professor of mine in when I got my B in my undergraduate days which were now quite a while ago he invited me out to lunch not just me um invited anybody who wanted to come out to lunch I remember um during his class uh he was starting a company and you know and he was just entrepreneurial and you know he was into the the the growing Tech world and uh and just wanted to you know talk to us um I don't know if many other people showed up but I got to have like a one-on-one meeting with him and we developed a uh a friendship a relationship um but I have kept in touch with him over the years he would end up uh investing in two of my businesses and uh and he became extraordinarily successful he founded a company go to my PC which was bought by Citrix and he founded uh AppFolio which is which has done extraordin well he's been extremely successful and this is another a just incredible human being um I I you know I can't thank him enough for uh for for the you know the the time the the resources he's given me the uh the the introductions he's G I mean he's he's just done so much for me um that has been quite a rewarding relationship that I've had and and the mentoring he's done for me um there I don't want to go off to any tensions but I do want to say this this this one this one thing with clouse um uh one of my early startups that I had he was an investor in and and he was he was the first investor and co-founder really with me and uh I would get pretty excited you know I was young and uh um and I was you know thinking certain ideas I had were just gold and they were going to be momentous and and he would say well you know yeah that sounds good that's a that's a great hypothesis and I would think what do you mean hypothesis this this is uh this this is going to be great and and we read an article together uh the article had talked about irrational exuberance and that a lot of these uh very successful Tech entrepreneurs were irrationally exuberant about their their ideas and he would remind me that uh I'm being irrationally exuberant but that's okay you need to be irrationally exuberant to succeed sometimes and and that can be a a positive quality they're going to be tough times you need to be motivated and passionate enough that that that's not going to deter you or derail you um and you know you need to have that uh that passion as you grow the company and as other people need to have that same vision that you have um but you know a lot of great lessons he has given me a l a lot of uh a lot of things to to both Claus and uh Judea what would be your advice for people who are just starting something starting in something that is challenging or complex maybe people who want to enter causality or gen General machine learning or people who want to start their own company in Tech or or outside it what would be your advice for them to keep going when they meet all those challenges on their way to be in Let It Be intellectual challenges or business challenges I've been given a lot of great advice and I feel like I have knowledge but I don't know that I have have a lot to a lot of value to give to somebody else in this respect because you know sometimes you do want to stop you you do want to be derailed um because you really are headed in a wrong direction and uh and you know certainly have to know when that's the case versus um no you need to stick through this and this is just a speed bump and uh and and you know the the great things will await you if you persevere um you know I can't make that judgment uh for anybody else I can say that in business you know this is an example of the the kinds of decision M decisions that you need to make um whether to whether to push forward whether to Pivot whether to make a tiny pivot whether to reimagine your whole business or or exit entirely these are big decisions and and decision- making is is is an area that's really interesting to me especially decisions that that are benefited from counterfactual analysis so my advice if somebody's how how do you push through or or what do you do in the face of obstacles and business business you know that's that's a decision that you need to make and my advice for decision- making uh learn counterfactual analysis and and and hopefully there there are other author there are other uh researchers that are writing interesting uh books and papers on the subject and you know read them hopefully I can contribute uh to this this growing body of knowledge and uh and and you can read my stuff as in Academia uh I think things maybe maybe are a little different I mean clearly it's the same in the sense of you know sometimes you are struggling with an idea but that's not a good idea or that's not a good path to solve this problem and you need to recognize that and and stop struggling and and do something else um but I guess uh you know maybe it's a little different from business in that those can be really great opportunities you know these hard problems are the kinds of problems that are very interesting to solve you know especially the high impact uh hard problems for me personally that's pretty exciting not that I have you know superpowers to solve uh solve problems but but that's fun you know these are the puzzles what keeps you going when you encounter something like this on your on your way I don't know a good answer because uh because it's not that it's not that I uh I tell myself oh Scott you've got to have conviction this looks like too hard of a problem but uh but no you've uh you know you got to persevere anyway I'll say a couple things about this um I I don't know that I've ever had that uh situation where the problem is too hard uh maybe because my ego won't tell me that uh hey you're not you're not capable of solving this or maybe it's because uh I haven't taken on too hard of a problem and uh and so even I certainly have problems and I'm working on things right now which are which the solution is not evident yet um but I believe the solution is there and uh and so if I believe a solution is there my mind is I got to find it and I'm the way my brain works and maybe the why it wasn't so it wasn't as good for business uh despite some successes and maybe it's better for Academia is you know I won't stop until until I find it or until I re recognize like okay it seemed like it was evident uh but no you know I've spent a lot of time on this and either it's not possible or I'm not the man to uh to find it I think I try to find problems that I feel confident I can solve mhm I don't really have a uh a a a discipline or recipe for sticking with problems that are too hard either because I just haven't given allowed myself to pursue those kinds of problems I look for I look for problems that I can solve or or you know or judeo call me up and say hey what do you think about this and and I'm like oh yeah that I I think I can do that what can people find out more about you and your work I should have a website I don't though um had you think in my former life and in Tech I I particularly should have a website well uh Judea has a website and on that he lists uh his papers and most of my papers have been with him as a co-author and so you'll find you'll find more work on on judea's website at UCLA but now you made me think I really should have a website I'm I'm going to make one you're also on Twitter right yes oh yeah that's true yeah I mean I don't I don't post a whole lot um but uh but I I do enjoy I do enjoy the academic side of Twitter Great Scott it was a pleasure thank you so much it was my pleasure
