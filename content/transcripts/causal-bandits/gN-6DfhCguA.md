An NF1 trial is a uh a study of one person. In the trial sense, it's randomized. It's a randomized trial. How useful are these designs? They don't generalize, do they? And the answer is that's correct. They're not meant to generalize. They're personalized models. That's the partial answer. The other part of that answer is they are meant to generalize to yourself. For people who would be interested in running experiments like this maybe on themselves or maybe uh designing trials like this what do you think would be some of the most important aspects to pay attention to at the design stage at the implementation stage and then analysis stage to make sure that uh our conclusions are really trustworthy or reliable.

The self-deprecating way I say it is you know I have I have pretty bad memory. uh most people can do that work and they understand it but I had to keep repeating it and that's the reason I had to get a doctorate because I needed to really push it into my brain. You know I keep coming back to Rubin's quote design trumps analysis. I don't know if at this point it's some kind of a mantra but uh that really is important but it extends even beyond causality because just thinking about you know what the study question is.

What is the question you're trying to answer? That is the roots of really good science. Hey Causal Bandits, welcome to the second season of the Causal Bandits podcast. The best podcast on causality and AI on the internet. He started with neurobiology but found his true passion in statistics. And it was theater, music, and a history of disease and his family that inspired him to switch gears. He studied at Cornell, Chapel Hill, and Stanford. trained concert pianist, creator of Stats of One and researcher, principal clinical data scientist at one of the leading pharma companies.

Please welcome Dr. Eric Daza. Let me pass it to your host, Alex Mole. Welcome to the podcast, Eric. Uh it's it's a great pleasure to have you here. I'm very glad you found uh time. It's very early in the morning for you. I know. Yes, it's uh it's uh it's it's getting uh not so early, but yes, it is quite early. Thank you for having me on the show. Amazing. I'm really I'm really happy to have you here and I think this topic that that we will talk about one of the topics at least that we will talk about today will be will be super interesting for for our audience.

And so I wanted to start with a question with a with a hardcore bump question. What is an NF1 trial? Ah perfect. Yes. The starting question. So an NF1 trial is a uh a study of one person uh in the trial sense it's randomized. It's a randomized trial and it's essentially a crossover design. So you're curious about, oh, you know, maybe does uh drinking coffee uh affect uh the amount of sleep I get, something like that. And you want to experiment on yourself. So you would randomize yourself. Maybe today I drink coffee, maybe tomorrow uh no coffee, something like that.

And then you see how much you sleep each night. Um and then you compare the average uh amount of sleep you get each night under coffee or no coffee. So that's like a a nice playful example of an N of one trial. Some of your listeners might know it as a time series design. So that's another way of saying it. Mhm. And what inspired you to to go into this particular direction when it comes to causality and causal methods? Well, let's see. With causal methods, I uh I actually worked in uh pharma as a biostistician uh with a master's degree many many years ago.

Won't say exactly when. And uh during that time I wanted to learn more about the statistics underlying the software you know programming I was doing as a stats programmer. And so I uh prepared to go back to grad school for a doctoral degree. And one of the courses that I ended up taking by chance was a causal inference course by Mark Vanderland. And let me tell you I had no idea what causal inference was. I'd never heard of it. And uh I had no idea who Mark was. So now I tell people it's like you know uh at least in the US if you uh took uh basketball lessons from uh LeBron James or Steph Curry and but you didn't know a you didn't know what basketball was and b you had no idea who those two people were.

So looking back now I'm like oh my gosh no wonder he was really good at it. And it's so uh interesting you know how uh he is able to explain these concepts. So that was causal inference for me. And then with NF1 after I got back into grad school, um I uh was about to graduate at the end and uh realized, oh, I I need to find a new focus. Uh so I like causal inference. Is there something I can do with it? Susan Murphy, Professor Susan Murphy came to campus and she gave a series of talks and uh your listeners might know that she uh works on dynamic treatment regimes which is um a branch of causal inference and it's personalized in a in a meaningful way.

I saw her work and I was I was uh very impressed and also very um daunted and uh she mentioned this other field called NF1 trials. Um so that's kind of like what sparked it for me. Plus, one of my uh loved ones has um irritable bowel syndrome, which is a very idiosyncratic chronic condition. It's the kind of thing that you can treat with an NF1 trial. So, that's that's kind of the three streams for how I got got here. In one of your papers, uh, you write about MOTR, model twin randomization that is a device that leverages the G formula or backdraw adjustment for for those of u those of us who are more on the PLAN side under serial interference.

What is serial interference? Yes. So serial interference is uh you'll you you'll recall interference in the you know the standard causal case where you have uh different people in the uh in the in the study and you know if it's you and me your treatment might affect my potential outcomes right and vice versa my treatment might affect your potential outcomes I come from public health so typically uh that's talked about with a vaccine example if I get vaccinated then both of your potential outcomes uh for the sickness are now kind of more protected.

So my treatment has affected your potential outcomes. That's interference between people. Now imagine that Eric and Alex are the same person but uh at different points in time. So now the interference is still between us. If I get vaccinated at time point one, it affects my potential outcomes at time point 2. But that's you. You're you're me in the future. whichever way you want to spin it to make it look uh better for you, of course, but uh that's the idea. Uh and so serial interference is just interference over time.

So the neat thing is uh you can't interfere with my potential outcomes because you're in the future for me. So you can't it can't interfere backwards. So that's really what serial interference is. What are the main challenges uh in in the settings of of time series and and and just one individual when we can have some carry carryover effects for instance and all those challenges that we can meet in in any um time series based scenario. Yes. So uh so carryover like you said is one of the uh the big ones and uh that just means that uh the treatment that I get now uh could impact uh the uh outcomes I have in the future.

So there's again uh a way to imply or induce serial interference and uh that's called carryover because the effect carries over into the future. You could also have uh just plain old autocorrelation. So perhaps you know uh if if I get like migraines, perhaps my migraine chances tomorrow are affected by my migraine chances today. whatever's predisposing me naturally um to get migraines today also makes me more um likely to get a migraine tomorrow. So that would be like autocorrelation. And you also have exogenous factors.

So things like the weather that can affect your outcomes uh over time. So those are things that are not affected by u your treatment or exposure or the outcome itself. Again, examples like the weather. I can't affect the weather with my coffee drinking or my migraine probability but it can affect both of those things. Um so those are the typical complications when you are trying to do causal inference in this setting. How do you deal with them uh in in those methods in those in those settings with just one with just one subject? Well, the the idea is that uh if you're trying to figure out for example what is cause like what's giving you migraines or what causes them to appear and affects their intensity uh then the idea is you're trying to figure out what the triggers are and uh what are the recurring triggers like is it usually when I drink more coffee that's what increases my chance of a migraine um maybe it's coffee for me but uh uh for you maybe you know If you get migraines, maybe coffee doesn't do anything for you.

It could be just the amount of sleep you get, or it could be your physical activity, your exercise, or it could be some some drug you're taking. So, these designs are very useful when you have um outcomes that have very heterogeneous triggers uh across people. Uh and by triggers, I even mean the same trigger. Perhaps for me, I drink coffee and it makes my migraines worse. But for you, you drink coffee and it's the opposite. it actually prevents your migraines. So if we had like if we had done a standard randomized control trial or even just a study observational study between people like you and me, you would find no average treatment effect.

They would cancel out because coffee is helping half the population and it's hurting the other half. So that really uh tells you where these designs fit in when it's really heterogeneous. In one of your papers you talk about uh the fact that today we have access to many measurements on personal level. So for instance people might record uh different indicators related to their to their personal health using things like Fitbit and and other types of personal um devices. In this paper you also talk about an estimate that is called average period treatment effect.

So we know that in the context of traditional randomized control trials we talk about at average treatment effect. Here you add this one uh p here apt average period treatment effect. Can you tell us a little bit more about this estimate and what's special about it? Sure. So the average period treatment effect the APTE is uh it's similar to the AT in the sense that it's also an average effect between two or more treatment levels um any pair of those right uh but just like when we were talking about um uh the time series setting and interference just now right so recall the difference between um interference and serial interference is with interference it's between people With serial interference, it's the same person over time.

So, in a sense, it's between people. It's just that same person. With the APTE, the period part, it's kind of a placeholder for um the time period. So, my time period at time period 1 versus time period 2. So, it's separating those two time periods out of the same person. So, it's just a way of describing an AT except across different periods of time for the same person. But the analogy is exactly the same. We're taking a group of of me at uh certain time periods when I drink a lot of coffee and the other group of me when I don't drink a lot of coffee and comparing the difference.

And that's that's all the uh the AP is those times those time segments are are called periods in the uh NF1 trials literature and that's why I picked that term. And when we analyze trials like this, what is is there anything specific about the statistical machinery that we use um to get to conclusions to to to build our inferences on top of this uh data coming from single subject studies, randomized single subject studies? It's a great question. The largest difference is that it is a time series setting.

So uh when you look at the assumptions in uh a standard group based trial or study usually you have uh an independence assumption independence between uh participants of the study. Here that assumption is replaced by something like um stationerity for one. So stationary me stationerity means that over time there there are basically averages that stay the same over a certain time span. Um and uh that's an additional assumption um compared to like the standard uh study that you do across people and then the independence assumption gets replaced with basically a wide sense stationary stationerity is part of it but um the errors are no longer dependent on each other after you control for things like lag and autocorrelation.

So you still have that independence assumption but uh you have to work more to get to it because now your lagged outcomes can be correlated with your present outcomes which is a uh very common complication in the time series setting. So those are the two basic differences and you know on top of that they have lots of downstream implications but um the modeling itself is pretty open and it's it's very analogous to the group based scenario. What would be some of the best materials you think for people who would be interested in learning more more about NF1 trials and of one trial? Well well shameless selfplug I do have a newsletter called stats of one.

There it is. Whoop. And uh and so at at Stats of One, we focus on a lot of the statistical methods, data collection, software, that kind of uh subject. We focus on those materials that are connected to NF1 trials, but also uh single case designs. That's what they're called in psychology and uh education. And uh a lot of the field actually has its roots in psychology and education. But uh again, I've mentioned time series. So there's an entire literature of time series where we have resources from that literature at uh the newsletter.

It also touches a field called functional data analysis where you're looking at you know instead of an average uh on a given day you're looking at the entire curve. So maybe it's like your step counts over the day and does your step count curve differ when you uh have coffee versus when you don't. And uh let's see and there's a lot of deep work that's been done in econometrics and uh and some a little bit in finance. In finance your uh much of your audience will know an NF1 trial as a switchback experiment.

So that's the same thing. It's uh it's this randomized or experimentally manipulated condition and you want to see is there a repeated pattern over time. So all those literatures have really great nuggets of information in them and at Stats of One we're just trying to bring them all together. So you know somebody from Switchbacks can talk to somebody from NF1 and say hey oh you worked on this um coariance structure. Oh we we already did that in our field. And then in the other way oh you know you're doing this missing data thing.

Oh yeah we did that here. So you know let's use our methods and uh and advance the field together that way. So yeah so that's that's one great resource. um the the we have a resources page in where you can find resources um in these areas um as well. So, and then I could list off things, but I'll I'll stop there and see if your audience gets curious about going to our resources page. I'm sure many people will. Um Eric, when you think about causal identification, let me take a step back here. You said you started with with Mark Fad and Vanelan.

uh you said about your background in epidemiology and we know that different schools of thought in causality uh sometimes refer to different traditions when it comes to the assumptions and different frameworks. I mean here mainly the potential outcomes framework and the plian so-called structural model uh framework. What are your thoughts about this framework and their application um to to the topic of causal identification in case of what in case of your area of interest NF1 trials? I did have one more thought briefly before I answer that.

Uh on the resources uh your audience, you should also check out the NF1 um collaborative network. Just, you know, search for that. Uh fantastic group of people. They're based out of Australia. I I learned a lot of my uh my first um foundational concepts in NF1 trials from them. They've been doing it for decades, so they're definitely the experts specifically in NF1 trials and that area. Um, so they're fantastic and they have like hundreds of subscribers as well. So they're they're great to check out.

That's great. We will link we we will add a link in the description of the video or the podcast for for our audio listeners listen listeners so everybody can will be able to go and visit their page. Definitely go check them out. Um, and then so to your question about the frameworks, your question was uh, you know, how how do they relate or you know how do they connect that kind of thing? My question was specifically in the in the context of identification, right? Causal identification. And how do you find those frameworks? Which one maybe is more useful or in more useful in which cases for you when you when you think about causal identification in your area of interest in in the area of NF1 trials? To be honest, I haven't I haven't pushed into um other areas myself outside of the potential outcomes framework.

I will say that uh and that's not to say, you know, you shouldn't. It's just that me in in my recent work, I haven't really explored the other frameworks that much. From what I know, I tend to uh lean on the DAG framework a lot, directed a cyclic graphs um from Pearl and others. And I find it uh I personally find it very useful because I am visual. I like to see where the arrows go and that helps me uh write out the equations that I need uh to see if the effect is actually identifiable, right? and how to construct a model to um estimate that effect or and to identify that effect.

So the DAG framework for me is is quite useful. Uh I've definitely leaned on that one a lot. It could be especially useful with NF1 uh and single case designs because again they're time series. So you're forced to draw this DAG that's recursive. it really hits home because you start to draw arrows from the past to the present and now that whole diagram is shifting over time. So it really helps you understand uh what you need to put in your model and what you don't what assumptions you're making when you don't draw an arrow.

I so I think that the the TLDDR for me is uh DAGs are great. They're great for coming up with an identifiable model. When we think about um running designing and running studies like this and of one studies, what would be your advice for people who would like to start with something like this? So maybe we have in our audience some people interested in things like nutrition or longevity that are aware of for instance Brian Johnson. So this is a person that is famous for doing a lot of experimentation on himself.

But he always emphasizes right that this findings he cannot give us a high probability that these findings will translate to other people because he only knows about about himself. For for people who would be interested in running experiments like this maybe on themselves or maybe uh designing trials like this. What do you think would be some of the most important aspects to pay attention to at the design stage, at the implementation stage and then analysis stage to make sure that uh our conclusions are really trustworthy or reliable? Great question.

So, two thoughts. One um with the uh the the comment about like generalizability. I get that a lot. Uh you know, how useful are these designs? They don't generalize, do they? And the answer is uh that's correct. They're not meant to generalize. They're personalized models. Um so that's partly that's the partial answer. The other part of that answer is they are meant to generalize to yourself to figure out in general for you what is the pattern. And then um other goals like do is there a pattern that's more general to other people? Those are secondary in the world of NF1 studies.

That's a secondary question. It's important and it connects to methods that borrow information across people. Uh in bioatistics typically they're mixed effects models. That's sort of the gateway I I tell statistitians I say look you know what a mixed effects model is or or random effects model depending on your terminology. Now take each person in that uh in that study look at it in a repeated measures way and voila there's your uh NF1. uh the NF1 addition is that the models per person can differ themselves.

You're not constraining them to have mostly the same model like you are in a mixed effects uh study or mixed effects analysis. That was about the generalizability piece. Now, if you're designing your own study, you it it's it's like designing a research study. You uh have to as much as possible specify the variables you're going to collect, what you're going to measure. You know, think about how you're going to measure them. Uh is it feasible? Are you going to use a a passive sensor like uh you know, a wristworn sensor? Are you going to use a daily diary? Are you going to take lab values? So, think about what you want to collect.

Um, but most importantly, think about the question that you want to answer because you can collect a lot of things and that's great. I, you know, if you're curious, that's awesome, but you have limited time and and money and resources and also probably patience if you're involving other people that are helping you collect these data on yourself. So, really think about the question you want to answer and then start to figure out what might be um what might help answer that question. number one and number two which of those things can you measure and how are you going to measure them and that will inform your design you know there's that wonderful quote of course by like Don Rubin design trumps analysis the point being that you really have to think about the study question and the variables involved and the timeline involved um and like to your point you know how are you going to collect that data and then analyze it uh what models you going to use those things are all more important than the analysis is because otherwise it's the the typical garbage in garbage out.

Like if you don't design it well, you can find lots of things that don't really translate to being meaningful or useful for you. On your web page, you have a section that talks about software that can be used when we work with NF1 trials. Can you give us a little bit of a glimpse into the software ecosystem that's that can be helpful in designing or analyzing the these types of studies? Yeah, I've talked to a number of folks over the years who have developed like self-d collection and experimentation uh type platforms, you know, for different applications.

One of the earliest was called uh tummy trials and it was for uh people with irritable bowel syndrome, which was close to my heart because that's what motivated me to go into the the field. I don't know if they progressed with that app. It was it was done for a study um and they may have converted it to a different kind of app. I'm not sure. Um I think Migraine Buddy is another one, but that's more on the self-tracking side. I don't know how much they help you then design your own self-experiment.

One of the the newest uh really awesome looking packages is called uh study study me I believe. Um, I don't know much about the package itself, but I I know the PI, um, Stefan Konorski, and, um, he's excellent. Does really fantastic work. So, I would encourage your listeners to go check out that package. Um, and of course, we can put these links in, you know, so they can check. Yeah, definitely. We'll put the links uh below in the description. Uh, below or just in the description, depends if you watch this as a video or or you just listen.

uh your journey into statistics or your statistical journey uh was very adventurous at at least it looks like. So you've been at Stanford, you've been at Chapel Hill, you've been at Coronell and you were doing various things at various moments in time. Um can you tell us a little bit more about your journey and how how it started? what inspired you to go into statistics and what was the and and what was the tra your trajectory later on when when you already knew that you want to learn more about statistics and then causal inference.

I hope this is inspiring for uh your listeners especially the ones that uh don't think of themselves as math people. So I I started off in undergrad as a neurobiology major. I was very interested in consciousness and you know what makes us conscious and and all that but very early on I developed a another interest in theater in student theater. Now I am a a pianist. I'm a trained concert pianist and so I had a musical background. Um I also lived in on purpose I lived in the dorm on campus that was the theater dorm.

We had our own studentrun theater and so that naturally drew me into that entire crowd. It also distracted the hell out of me. Uh I was constantly working on theater projects instead of my homework. Uh this appears if you look at my grades, you'll see that there's this uh inverse curve of my uh my academic performance and my theater involvement goes like that over time. Um so I was still very interested in neurobiology, but I had a lot of trouble concentrating. So towards the end of my undergrad, I was uh taking a cognitive studies course and we had a lab component where you had to design your own experiment and analy collect the data from your fellow students who are subjects and then analyze the data.

And that was really the bug that got me because at the end of undergrad I uh I still love neurobiology but I realized after after doing the the classwork and uh doing a bit of lab work and summer jobs in neurobio I realized oh I don't really necessarily want to do this kind of work. I think it's very interesting. The findings that come out of it are fascinating but to do the the bench work the field work ah it's it's okay. So discovering this cognitive studies class and uh the spark of uh designing the experiment and analyzing the data that was a really nice find at the end of my my undergrad career.

So that sparked it but you know it was my fourth year uh in the US it's four years long and I was about to graduate and then my school came up with this brand new one-year master's program in applied statistics. So to me that was a I like to say it's a statistically significant moment. The universe is telling me ah you're getting interested in stats and now you have this program. We have this new program for you and it's only one year long. So I had to prepare for it. Of course I was not a math major and again I at that point my grades had dropped.

I had a lot of trouble focusing. Um but I really like hooked on to it and prepared for it. Um I fought to get in uh you know with with myself with you know training myself to take the intro math courses and all that. I got in one of my proudest moments uh finished the masters a year later and that set me off on the rest of my journey. So that journey would take me um briefly it would take me through pharma for about 5 years. I was a master's level biostatistician at a small mid-size pharma company and during that time realized uh the work I was doing was statistical programming but I really wanted to know more about the underlying concepts in statistics you know like why do I do a t test here I know it's it says it so in the manual like do the t test but why I like to the self-deprecating way I say it is you know I have I have pretty bad memory uh most people can do do that work and they understand it.

But I had to keep repeating it and that's the reason I had to get a doctorate because I needed to really push it into my brain as much as possible just to do the work that other people could already do. So that that was my drive to get back in and uh yeah so so briefly I got into after after three years I applied to uh doctor doctoral programs in bioatistics. I didn't get in. I applied to 10 programs. I uh didn't get into any of them, but I knew that I knew my academics were mediocre at the time.

Uh I just needed to go out there, apply to these programs, and you know, get literally get data on what do I need to do to get into the program. UNC Chapel Hill uh was fantastic. They flew uh maybe 30 or 40 students, prospective students out to Chapel Hill and gave us a tour. Uh you know, we stayed there for a few days. They told us about the program and they told us, you know, we won't accept all of you, but we just wanted you to understand this kind of program. So, it really left a good impression on me.

And the uh graduate admissions director at the time um Suchi uh rest in peace is wonderful man. Uh he was very encouraging and targeted and he said look we love your work experience. Uh you could do better academically so here's what you do. It's kind of like a doctor like take two pills and call me in the morning. uh and he said you know take these courses to prepare you for this program and then you'll be much more competitive. So I did that over two years uh from that point on uh and that's when I met uh Mark Vanderland because he was one of the the professors whose class I took by chance uh to get into grad school and that set me off and then and then there's that whole journey.

And what inspired you to to go to uh neurobiology in the first place? Yeah, when I was uh in high school and and before that, you know, I moved to the US from the Philippines uh and I had the kind of stereotypical middle upper middle class Asian upbringing where my parents, you know, they encouraged their kids, okay, go be a doctor or a lawyer or an engineer. Those three things pretty stable. Uh they, you know, they were they were very encouraging. we could pursue whatever we wanted. But that was kind of the average good advice, right? And that's true of a lot of immigrant groups, not just Asians, of course.

Uh so premed, that's the short answer. Uh I was encouraged to be premed, but uh but again, I was my my brain was kind of all over the place. And I also wanted to do music, so I pursued a music major for a while. That's part of what explained my grades tanking because I was trying to do music and biology. So yeah, the premed is what got me into biology and then the biology is what got me into uh neurosych and cognitive studies and then that got me into statistics which is where I am today. The one little bit that your audience will appreciate is that uh I I discovered last year two years ago um I was diagnosed with ADHD so neurode divergence and that explained a lot of why I wasn't able to focus in my early days.

Um and it explained a lot of how I was able to do work as a functioning adult because I would procrastinate until the last moment and then do it. procrastinate and do it. And I got very good at turning those time periods into small chunks. So then I would still procrastinate but I would do it and then I would do these little tasks along the way. So so that's something that yeah hopefully your audience finds some uh some inspiration and also some encouragement along those lines. That's very interesting.

Um, you know, um, I haven't summarized it statistically, but I think maybe even majority of guests at this podcast have something to do with music. They play instruments. They used to be musicians and so on and so on. And I myself used to be a music producer and a musician also. And I had my own studio and and and that was a large large part of my life at some point. I was very curious if are there any lessons from music like playing music or understanding music understanding harmony understanding structure that you found useful in your work as a scientist or statistician? It's a fantastic question that I have not really thought about in any depth but it it has definitely come up because uh in in these quant fields again anecdotally it it there does seem to be a sense that there are a lot of folks who have some tie to music um or some kind of creative outlet but music comes up a lot.

The closest off the top of my head that comes to mind there's two things. One is uh um I also used to write a little bit I write a little bit of music and uh I love the notation structure and I would just write those notes and yada yada and if you're familiar with musical western musical notation they come in bars and bars are kind of like time periods that repeat. So, you know, in my head, I'm like, maybe maybe that it's got to be, right? That's got to be some part of what in the back put me into this time series and of one world.

That's like it really clicked for me. The second thought is, uh, this is super nerdy. Uh, I'll just reveal, it's not really an Easter egg, but the newest paper I'm working on that will hopefully be in print uh, this year. uh in it I defined a quantity uh that's a so like um at a given point in time say I have like my migraine probability but maybe it's been affected by my coffee drinking in the past um or there's different patterns of coffee drinking I could have taken to affect that migraine probability uh and uh and now I have my my uh potential uh outcome of my migraine probability if I drink coffee today versus I don't given my entire past, right? So, if you average over all of those past streams of drinking coffee or not drinking coffee, you have this average potential outcome and you have them under both the coffee drinking and the not coffee drinking conditions.

So, I call that in the paper I call that the current average potential outcome. It's based on an approach that Hudgens and Howerin have taken you know some folk a lot of folks in the interference literature. Um, so side plug, this happens a lot when you have ADHD. Side thoughts. Side plug. Uh, Hudgens was my adviser in grad school. So that's another that's another very clear reason I got interested in this this area of NF1 because of the interference. Anyways, it's called the current average potential outcome.

Current average potential outcome spells capo. So from my work as a musician, the capo, right? Like that was on purpose. That was definitely on purpose because I also love word play and puns. Taking advantage of the of the fact that we got a little bit back into into the main topic of our conversation or main technical topic of our conversation so to say um and of NF1 trials. Yeah. I wanted to ask you uh what are some of the most interesting or surprising results that you've seen um as conclusions from the single single individual trials? And I'm asking here about your own research, but also anything else that you've seen in the literature that really drew your attention.

There's nothing nothing no one thing particular comes to mind. It's it's really, you know, looking at the literature, for example, on migraines um and irritable bowel syndrome and just seeing the heterogeneity across the the different participants. I mean nowadays you can find a lot of studies that have that do secondary data analysis. they'll take uh a paper uh that has a lot of heterogeneity or perhaps there doesn't seem to be like an average association or an effect and then they'll look at the different participants and there's a lot of heterogeneity between the participants right so there's no one particular finding it's it's more um this realization that looking at NF1 ones is kind of the natural progression if you're interested in heterogeneous treatment effects or the current I'm sorry the um conditional average treatment effect right so you those all of both of those cases you're essentially looking at smaller and smaller subgroups of people well if you keep going down that logical chain you get to one person and and in fact the literature in my opinion and those of some of my colleagues there's a misnomer in the literature of calling that the individual treatment effect or individualized treatment effect and it's really not.

It's a small group treatment effect. It's just that the groups keep getting smaller. So, it's it's an individual treatment effect if uh you know if everybody in the group has that same effect then sure. But the the bottom up approach would be an N of one approach and it doesn't always work right. It it works for recurring conditions. If you have something irreversible like death, then you can't study it like a net of one because it only happens once. Um but if it's recurring uh then you can study it that way.

So yeah, I'm very much with you regarding the the misnome misnomer diagnosis here, especially when it comes to individual treatment effects because clearly uh conditional average treatment effects are not individual effects. Sometimes call them some people call them as you mentioned individual individualized treatment effects and I think that's a better name because well that makes sense. They are more individual than than the average. uh but individual treatment effect is is a purely counterfactual quantity right that we never have access to if we look from the um perian identification point of view and I think I think that's that's good to make this distinction here I remember I was reviewing a paper for a British journal of u of psychology maybe I don't remember yeah British journal of psychology and and there was a review article about causal inference methods and that was one my main comments that that using this nomenclature can be very very confusing for some people right because without a clear definition it can mean very many many different things.

Uh before we before we move forward, one thought that comes to my mind often when I think about designs like this like kind of one trials is about the fact that we might not always know if there are some changes in the background in the distribution of of the outcome right that we that we just are not aware of. How do you deal with things like this that there there is no stationerity for some factors maybe maybe for all maybe for just some of them as always I have a trailing thought from the last thing uh that I'll mention uh briefly first but uh with the individual lies treatment effect um even with NF1s you still have the fundamental problem of causal inference right so I can get an average individual treatment effect for me but the fundamental problem of at any given point I only took one exposure of one treatment.

So I don't know what the other one is. It's still there, but it's now just done over time. So just just a quick note there. So with background uh information or like non-stationerity, this is definitely one of the upfront challenges. uh in an NF1 trial, a classic NF1 trial, it's designed by the clinician and co-designed with the patient uh and they know what the exposures are, their their therapeutics, their drugs, and so they know they you control a lot of the the components that go into the model, right? Because you know what the treatments are, number one, so you know how long they stay in your body, number two.

So that means you can wait for it to wash out before you randomize again. Um and number three, you're randomizing it. So you've already controlled that piece. You only do it within say a few weeks. So you know that the time series that are involved are fairly stationary by design. So that's in that highly controlled setting of an NF1 trial. And you're also, you know, you're talking to your patient, so you know if uh they, you know, got sick or you're aware of other things that could impact whatever that outcome is.

In the real world, it is uh it is tough and uh I have no good answer here. I did set up a framework to address those concerns to formalize you know um what the variables should be called and and whatnot. there is work that's being done on how to conduct this kind of analysis if the time series are not stationary. Um so I think like u people have taken uh markoff chain type processes uh to look or like um what is it um markoff states and now I'm blanking but uh that idea where you can look at the latent state and then look at the transitions right in my opinion that changes the question because if you look at a transition probability it's it's useful of course um but it's a slightly different question maybe from your original question.

So there's always like trade-offs. Um in my 2018 paper where I set up this framework, I did address uh stationarization. So you could try to stationerize your your time series by taking like the first difference, but that changes the study question. Now you're asking about the derivative, the difference. Again, not that it's bad, but it's changing what you're answering, and you should be aware of that. So, so there are some some things you can do like that. The trade-off is they change the study question and then of course if there's factors in the background, you know, you're going to need some diagnostics in your modeling to see, oh, is is the time series still shifting? Um like for even with stationerity like uh in in my 2018 paper in the analysis I conducted I I ran uh two tests for stationerity on the residuals because if they don't hold it's it's like the independence assumption in group based designs like you need that assumption to hold and if not you got to find a way maybe your time series is stationary from here to here and then from here to here so you can segment it that way.

changepoint detection and other methods are used to try to find those stationary periods you know so that's another uh remedial strategy I think what's next for one n of one trials uh what are the big uh questions or big challenges that maybe somebody who who's u interested in those topics you would say it would be worthwhile for them to focus on these areas to move the entire field forward oh my gosh well um there's the the there's a field of NF1 trials itself and uh those because of the the like the fantastic work they're doing in Australia at the NF1 collaborative network.

They're really helping to uh they've been help for for decades again. They've been helping to popularize the design and the implementation of it. They actually run a consulting service. So listeners should check them out. You can get involved with that group. I think they're called the NF1 um it's NF1 something but they have this that's this consulting group that's affiliated with that team and then on for my area um mine's at stats of one we're trying to connect a lot of different fields not just NF1 trials and studies and single case designs so like I'm really excited about functional data analysis in that area I'm actually in the middle of a conference right now that I'm attending virtually um on digital health uh technologies and digital health analyses and designs and there are a lot of my colleagues and talks that focus on person specific designs and they're looking at not just the means and the medians that are repeated but your curves of again I mentioned like step count but you can also look at blood glucose um if you are a type 1 type two diabetic you can look at athletic performance so all those things can have these interesting curves that are average for you that uh perhaps are different um are likely different under different conditions.

So functional data analysis is another place and then I very recently got uh turned on to this really really nice uh I think it's just it's a preprint for now I hope it gets published it connects an causal inference to uh control theory and system identification and that is fantastic like I I I I can't go into that myself you know I don't have time but I've wanted to go to see that connection for a few years now because one of my early colleagues in NF1, Eric Heckler, uh, brought that up. He's a psychologist by training.

He's at UCSD and, uh, he's been interested in using those engineering techniques to to ask questions about human behavior and like how can we optimize to get you back to a stable point or to bring you to a stable point. Can we use these uh impulse response system identification techniques from control theory uh to do that? So yeah, this new preprint is out. Uh it's just it's really it's really yummy. I hope to see it published. Yeah, that sounds very timely when we think about agentic systems as well, right? uh this this the problems the problem with learning uh reliable world models is is I think very very crucial today and it's probably one of those problems that are at the at the forefront of u of of the questions that we need to answer somehow if we want to move forward with the entire field.

though that sounds very really very very interesting and that was actually one of the questions I had in the back of my head and was thinking about asking you if we have still some time but you already partially answered so that's really great Eric what are two books that changed your life let's see so when I was younger I I read a lot of sci-fi and uh a book that that has kind of uh really appeared a lot in my later professional life were it was the uh the Foundation novels by Asimov. And I read those probably in high school, maybe college, but I didn't realize how foundational those books would become to my current career, right? Because it's all about uh using data and an understanding of human behavior to try to predict large events in human history.

And lo and behold, I am now a statistician. So that book in retrospect had an outsized impact on uh the rest of my life. It's one of those things where I I'm I'm I wasn't aware of it at the time or at least I can't remember if I was aware of it when I was thinking of going into statistics, but clearly now it's become um a big piece of of what I do. And it's a book I will try to encourage other folks to read because you can, you know, get this wonderful playful idea or also dark idea of how things can go.

Sci-fi is a wonderful field because it's it's authors, it's human beings trying to uh see these they're not counterfactual yet because they don't exist, but these possible futures, these potential future outcomes, right? And uh and that book did did a great job of it. really kind of um resonated with me when I was when I was younger. Yeah. So that's that would be the one that's uh at least relevant to this conversation. What would be your advice for people who are just starting in an advanced field like statistics, machine learning, causality, get into the data, get, you know, start working on things, start coding, start working through the math.

Really just start doing the work. uh don't be don't uh it's it's easy to find it very daunting. Uh I certainly did and I just kind of hammered at it. But what I learned to appreciate were these little steps and the little steps you take that you know the five uh practice problems in the back of the textbook or on the on the web page that you do. They start to feel really good and then before you know it, you're much further up the mountain than you thought. I'm sure I' I'm probably stealing this from some philosopher somewhere, but I like to think of it like the hypotenuse for the quantitative folks where, you know, you have like this big step that you it's like, oh my gosh, I I want to take this big step forward.

Oh, but it's so big. What if I break it up? Okay, now it's a little more manageable. And then you break it up and it's a little more manageable. And if you add up those distances, they still add up to the same big step. But if you take it in the limit to that bot news ah it's actually shorter than that. So you've you've kind of in a strange way uh mentally you know emotionally psychologically you've helped yourself get there by taking all these little steps. So really the summary is like just start find something interesting collect that data or find that data and start uh tinkering with it playing with it analyzing it.

what's the study question? What um you know what are the data variables I need? And you will start to learn very quickly about the things that we have to deal with. Oh, the data are not clean. Oh, I can't even get the data from this. Oh, what time did I collect that data? All these like wonderful little challenges that you never really thought of. You won't see them until you start trying to do it. So, just so start trying to do it. That's pretty much it. Just do it. But you know, Nike said that, so I can't say it.

I think that's a great advice. What question would you like to ask me? Oh my gosh. Um, I think you you uh actually partially answered it already, which was I was curious about how you got into this uh this field yourself. Well, actually, I guess you you have it because you talked about you you did a lot of work uh musically uh which explains your finesse with the podcasting. So, I am very glad of that. Yeah. How did Yeah. What was that journey like for you? Like how did you get in? That's a long story.

Um but in a nutshell um I think you know the really starting point I think was when I was a child I just imagine that you know the world seemed very big for me. But um but I imagine that if you change your perspective, you if you just like kind of zoom out, you yourself can see yourself as like a very small point, right? Like um like just like an in like a tiny insect on on a huge dog or something and then you zoom out and the earth itself becomes like such a small point and so on and so on. And so this was one of the moments I think really that really somehow switched something in me when when I had this realization.

I was I was I don't know maybe four or five years old back then. Um and and I think that was one of the things that inspired me to go and study philosophy later on and when I started starting when I started studying philosophy I got interested in uh in logic in formal logic and and this kind of stuff. And later on in my life, I had a long period of relatively long period of time when when I was doing music professionally. I had my own studio. Uh later on I decided to go back and study something that was very interesting became very interesting to me at the moment and that was psychology and neuroscience.

M so when I went to study uh psychology uh in the first year I had stats class in introductory stats course and I just in the stat course you know I was I was I was always interested in science so I I like to go to Wikipedia and like read about physics or something like this and um one of the one of the huge u challenges for me was mathematical notation you know I because yeah I I was just like I just didn't know any any any more complex mathematical notation. And so in the stat class and that's I don't know that's um even maybe embarrassing to to to an extent but I remember that the the our professor the teacher she was she was an amazing teacher really amazing teacher she noted some formula maybe even for just for for the average using the sigma notation for the sum right and I didn't know what what that is I don't know how but I didn't know and I was like sorry what what does it mean you know and she's like you don't know I know I don't know so it's sigma you just sum you just sum the values I was like what? I've seen this on these Wikipedia pages and I thought this is something very complex and this is such a simple idea and it just like opened my mind so much before I because I understood that now if I understand the sigma I can understand a lot of stuff and if that was so simple all all other notation probably is not much more complicated.

It just maybe you know maybe it takes more time but I can just learn it. That was a time when I just just something switched in my mind and opened me to to statistics and I got very very fascinated in statistics. Yeah. But then doing my own research I realized that you know um those methods I had so many questions. I don't know mediation analysis I was taught mediation analysis in a in a statistical approach for mediation analysis which which is not really causally meaningful I would say which which I understood uh years later when when I started reading Pearl and counterfactual approach to to mediation analysis.

uh but but somewhere on the way I got I got I heard about machine learning um and then I got fascinated with machine learning and I said like I need to understand this. So I started studying machine learning on my own. I started working in industry and so on and and and this problem uh that certain questions that we we actually cannot answer certain questions with machine learning. Similarly to what my experience me when when I was studying uh psychology and when I was trying to apply those statistical methods that I loved you know to answer different types of questions I I was I was always hitting the same wall and so this brought me to to causality that was I think there were many coincidences on the way you know I just was at some conference somebody said about hey the book of why somebody said about something else you know and I started reading about it so that was my journey in in a nutshell.

Uh I think it's it's um yeah um that that that's it in a nutshell. Wonderful. Thank you. Yeah. I I'm I apologize. I realize coming out my mouth like, "Oh, no. This is a very big question." Usually I'm good at being more targeted with my questions, but that's fine. I I'm glad to hear that we we seem to hit a lot of uh very similar notes in our path. Yes. Yes. I I feel so music and neuroscience, right? And and statistics. Yeah. And for also again for your your audience, the um um I love what you were saying your your story about the sigma notation and I know you and I talked about this a little earlier but uh statistics and math for me was very hard.

It was specifically stats is one of the hardest things I have ever done. And that's part of my story for how I got into it. Um it was something I could really focus on. Uh right. And in retrospect, now that I understand my own context, my conditional uh statement that I have ADHD, uh when you find something like that, yeah, you could focus on it's it's a gold mine because now you obsess about it. It's so hard. Oh, I got to figure this out. And uh and let me tell you, and even in my first year of the doctoral program at the age of I think I was 28 at the time, you know, my my fellow students, almost all of them had come straight from undergrad.

they were quant background people. Uh they'd been doing math notation for a long time and they kept doing it. And I was so happy when I I re remembered how to integrate like oh this is how you integrate. Uh, and even in stats, right, the big X versus the little X notation, I I got so confused like it's the same letter and you know, you have to learn it's not the same letter. But because of that, all those little things were felt so good for me. And so now I'm very uh proud of and like I really focus on um can we can we say this in a mathematical way because I spent a lot of time learning those skills which are really for me really hard.

Um, so yeah, anyways, just for your audience to know like yes, you could do it and like I it was I wouldn't call myself a natural by any means. I worked my butt off at it and uh and now it's become very satisfying. Yeah, that's really great. And and congrats on your and congrats your perseverance. It's I think it's it's really really impressive. Eric, thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Before we finish, what's your message to the coal Python community or coausal community in general? Oh, wow. Uh, I would say, you know, I keep coming back to Rubin's quote, design trumps analysis.

Uh, I don't know if at this point it's some kind of a mantra, but uh, that really is important. Um, but it extends even beyond causality because just thinking about you, you know, what the study question is, what what is the question you're trying to answer? Uh, that is the root of really good science. Um because from that question you start to you start to create the details, the specifics. What does the question mean? What does it specifically mean? What do uh what variables do I need to answer that question? It doesn't even have to be quantitative.

It's just what are the pieces I need to answer that question? So when when you go into a doctoral program, that's really the the big lesson that you get. It's in my opinion, it's not so much about the field of study. It's training in the ability to ask and then start to answer a question deeply. Um, you're trained to push push yourself on on what the question is. What does that mean? Now, specify okay, what are you assuming when you specify this, this, this, and this? Are those assumptions okay? Yeah.

So, that's really it. Now, I'm not saying go get a go get doctoral trainer or anything, but that's the skill set that I find very useful in approaching questions and okay, so I'm going to go even bigger. Um, stats for me has been really fulfilling because it helps even with my personal life. And uh, just thinking about, oh, why did this person react this way or why did this person love this or like they were upset at this when I said it or they were upset at somebody else or they really loved it when this person did this.

It helps helps you kind of tease apart what's going on in your life. You can apply that to personal things to politics to you know your budget whatever but those skills are things that I learned for me through uh the practice of statistical reasoning. So that was not a short answer. I I try to keep it short but Eric thank you so much. I I really appreciate I really appreciate your time. It was a great conversation and I hope to see you again in the podcast in some time. Thank you, Alex. Yeah, thank you so much for having me on your show.

Um, I really love this show, so it's a it's a treat for me to be on. So, thank you. Great. Amazing. Thank you so much.
