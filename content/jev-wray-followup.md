Jev,

Appreciate you sending my interest over to Aaru. Thanks for the chat on Friday. I appreciated the overview of the role and especially you going over Cameron and John's wishes for the new hire. As you could probably tell, it's a very attractive proposition to me -- really a union of the domains I'm passionate about and the methodologies I've mastered over several years. The idea of bringing my management experience to bear to steer a young company, with energetic people working 996 is attractive as well.

I'll shoot over an updated resume tomorrow (the one I provided in the videocall setup was updated 6 months ago and wasn't tailored -- maybe it'll be helpful/maybe they won't look at it) but in the meantime, do you think John would be amenable to meeting up in person? There's a lot to discuss, should they be interested in my skills and background, and for a big move like this it might be superior to videoconference. You can let him know I'd be happy to cover coffee or lunch if he can make the time. Let me know.

Beyond the modeling side, I think there's a real BD opportunity I could help with on the hedge fund front. Synthetic population data is exactly the kind of alternative signal quant funds are starving for (sentiment, consumer behavior, political risk) and most of what's currently available is garbage (I would know: I led the search for alternative data signals when I was at D. E. Shaw). I have real connections into that world and could be a bridge. Do you know if these guys have ever looked into it?

I'll leave it there. If it's easier to hop on the phone rather than reply here, feel free to give me a buzz (1-651-283-8726). I hope you had a productive weekend and taxes are in the mail. I will say, I installed OpenClaw (an open-source agentic AI framework -- basically an always-on AI assistant that connects to your messaging, browser, and local tools) right before we spoke Friday and have been messing around with it since -- I have a feeling it's going to make my taxes a lot easier this year.

Cheers, and thanks again. Regardless of how things work out, I definitely owe you a beer or two. 🙂

Sam
