# Examine Outreach — Follow-Up Sequence

---

## Overview

Target: **Kamal Patel**, Co-founder & Director, Examine.com
Primary channel: Email (via Examine contact or direct)
Secondary channel: LinkedIn
Cadence: Space touchpoints ~5-7 days apart. Don't be a pest.

## Touchpoint 0: LinkedIn Connection Request

Send the same day as (or day before) the cold email. Keep it short -- LinkedIn requests with long messages get ignored.

> Hi Kamal -- Sam Cialek, founder of Serif. We're building personalized health recommendations using Bayesian updating on population-level evidence, and Examine's evidence base keeps coming up as the ideal prior source. Sent you an email with more detail, but wanted to connect here too.

**Character count:** ~280 (under LinkedIn's 300-char limit)

---

## Touchpoint 1: Initial Cold Email

See: `examine-outreach-email.md`

**Timing:** Send Tuesday or Wednesday morning, 9-10 AM HST (Kamal is based in Hawaii). Avoid Monday mornings and Friday afternoons.

---

## Touchpoint 2: First Follow-Up (Day 5-7, no response)

**Subject:** Re: Examine's evidence base as Bayesian priors -- a methodological question

---

Hi Kamal,

Following up on my note from last week -- I know inboxes are brutal.

The short version: I'm building an inference layer that uses population-level evidence as Bayesian priors and updates them with individual wearable/biomarker data. Examine's evidence base is the most rigorous candidate I've found for constructing those priors -- no conflicts, systematic methodology, comprehensive coverage.

I put together a one-page technical brief on how the integration would work if that's easier to evaluate than an email thread. Happy to send it over, or I can keep it to a 15-minute call if you'd prefer.

Either way -- appreciate what you and the team have built.

Best,
Sam

## Touchpoint 3: Second Follow-Up (Day 12-14, no response)

Shift the angle slightly. Reference something specific and recent from Examine -- a new study summary, a research update, anything that shows you're paying attention to their work.

**Subject:** [reference to recent Examine content] + the Bayesian integration angle

---

Hi Kamal,

Last note from me on this -- I don't want to be the guy who sends five follow-ups.

I was reading Examine's updated summary on [specific topic -- e.g., "the magnesium and sleep evidence"] and it struck me again how well the evidence synthesis format maps to prior construction. The way your team handles heterogeneity and study quality is essentially what a Bayesian modeler would want as input -- structured effect estimates with explicit uncertainty.

If the timing isn't right, no hard feelings at all. But if you're ever curious about what it looks like when systematic evidence synthesis meets individual-level inference, I'd love to show you. The clinical results have been surprisingly strong (92% retention, which I didn't expect).

Cheers,
Sam

## Touchpoint 4: Alternate Channel (Day 20+, no response)

If no response to emails, try one LinkedIn message. This is the last attempt before moving to warm introductions.

**LinkedIn message:**

> Hi Kamal -- I sent a couple of emails about using Examine's evidence base as Bayesian priors for personalized health recommendations (via Serif). Totally understand if it's not on your radar right now. If you're ever curious about the methodology, I'm easy to find. Appreciate your work on the evidence synthesis side -- it's rare to see that level of rigor outside of an EPC.

## Alternative Paths (if direct outreach doesn't land)

1. **Sol Orwell** -- Examine's other co-founder. More business-minded (sold websites, Forbes-profiled entrepreneur). May be more receptive to the commercial angle of data licensing. Has stepped back from active Examine operations but still involved.

2. **Gregory Lopez** (Editor in Chief) -- PharmD, molecular biophysics background. May be the right technical counterpart if Kamal delegates research partnerships.

3. **Warm intro via shared network** -- Check if anyone in the Columbia (CBS), Johns Hopkins, or Ancestral Health Symposium networks can bridge. Kamal chaired the 2013 Ancestral Health Symposium -- that community is tight-knit.

4. **Conference/event route** -- Kamal has done podcast appearances (Robb Wolf's show, among others). If he's speaking at or attending any upcoming events, an in-person introduction is always stronger than cold email.

## Notes

- **Lead with methodology, not business.** Kamal is a researcher first. The MBA helps him appreciate commercial viability, but the hook is the intellectual alignment.
- **Respect the independence brand.** Examine is fiercely anti-conflict-of-interest. Frame data licensing as cleaner than ads/sponsorships -- which it is.
- **Don't oversell.** Sam's voice is honest about uncertainty. "The clinical results have been surprisingly strong" is better than "we've achieved breakthrough results."
- **The EDS angle is personal.** Kamal co-founded Examine partly because of his Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and the difficulty of applying general research to individual conditions. The entire Bayesian personalization pitch speaks to that personal experience -- but don't be heavy-handed about it. Let the methodology make the connection.
