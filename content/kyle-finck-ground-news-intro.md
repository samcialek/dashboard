Hey Kyle,

Hope you're well — been a while since CBS. Saw you landed at YouTube on the news partnerships side, which makes a lot of sense given the Apple News + Flipboard trajectory.

Quick ask: I've been building something I think would be interesting to Ground News, and I noticed you're connected to Harleen Kaur. Would you be open to making an intro?

Here's the short version: I've been developing a political disposition model (PRISM) that maps people across 16 latent dimensions into ~130 archetypes — basically a generative model of how someone's worldview shapes what they notice, trust, and dismiss in information. I've been writing it up on my blog Matrices of Confusion, which gets about 1,000 readers a day now.

Ground News already does the supply side of media bias really well — rating sources, showing coverage gaps. What they don't have is the demand side: a model of the reader. The idea would be to pair their source-level bias detection with reader-level disposition modeling, so you could show someone not just "here's how different outlets covered this" but "here's how someone with your worldview is likely to interpret each framing."

I'm not looking for a job there — this would be more of a research collaboration or data partnership. Figured given your world (news + tech + partnerships), you might have a read on whether Harleen would be receptive to a cold pitch or if an intro would help.

No pressure either way. Happy to send more detail if it'd be useful context before you decide.

Cheers,
Sam
