    "desc": "In a world of daemons and AI everywhere, everything becomes about N-of-1 and personalization — the 'last mile' of intelligence. The value shifts to millions of systems that can perform personalizing functions better. The agent isn't just a tool; it's a model OF you. Serif = N-of-1 health (individual-level causal inference from wearables). PRISM = N-of-1 politics (archetypes as cluster centers, but placing a specific person in trait-space). Aaru = N-of-1 simulation at population scale. The common thread: estimation inverts to simulation. Instead of 'what's the average effect?' you ask 'what does THIS person do under THESE conditions?'",

    "desc": "Social justice, properly understood: you care about accessibility, egalitarianism, people with disabilities. One implication is understanding power dynamics and questioning entrenched systems — but as a MEANS to an END (achieving the justice you seek). 'Wokeness' as pejorative = doing only the means (questioning systems, calling out power) without caring about the end. The system-questioning becomes the identity, detached from the actual outcome it was supposed to serve. It's the difference between instrumentally questioning power structures and ritualistically performing the questioning.",

The spark of creativity becomes the new product and value people offer. The scarce resource isn't labor or even knowledge anymore, it's taste, curation, and the ability to get inspired. Work is downstream of inspiration.",

The deeper question is top-down vs. bottom-up: Western medicine's overemphasis on active ingredients is mediator bias. Captain Cook's scurvy cure is the perfect case — he got the mediator wrong (thought it was acidity, not Vitamin C). Western med has overlearned this reductionist lesson. TCM's holistic approach may capture interaction effects that active-ingredient thinking misses.",
