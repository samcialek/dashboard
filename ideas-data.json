The deeper question is top-down vs. bottom-up: Western medicine's overemphasis on active ingredients is mediator bias. Captain Cook's scurvy cure is the perfect case — he got the mediator wrong (thought it was acidity, not Vitamin C). Western med has overlearned this reductionist lesson. TCM's holistic approach may capture interaction effects that active-ingredient thinking misses.",
